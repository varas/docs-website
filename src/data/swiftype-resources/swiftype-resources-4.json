      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5.

To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using Full-Stack Observability options like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page.

Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include.

You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces.

Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "With the PHP agent, you can add browser monitoring to your pages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "The PHP agent captures special metrics for Drupal websites. When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5.

For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive.

You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination.

Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination.

Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

The newrelic_name_transaction API function can be used wherever a custom transaction name is needed. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_name_transaction ($controller .

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used.

Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

The newrelic_name_transaction API function can be used wherever a custom transaction name is needed. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_name_transaction ($controller .

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive.

You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

The newrelic_name_transaction API function can be used wherever a custom transaction name is needed. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_name_transaction ($controller .

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

'/' . $action); } Copy Tip Note: Do not name your transactions with values that change often, such as user IDs, hashes, and so on. Implement useful transaction naming in your API calls. Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events.

Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events.

If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Cause New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic_custom_metric(string $metric_name, float $value) Copy Add a custom metric (in milliseconds) to time a component of your app not captured by default. Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully. Examples Record a 100 millisecond response time function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_custom_metric(\"Custom/custom-metric-name\", 100.00); } } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to...

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",
