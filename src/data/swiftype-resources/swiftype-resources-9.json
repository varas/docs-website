      "body": "Single page applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page. The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use Browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use Browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by Browser monitoring can include: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in Browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in Browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing Browser account's data usage, see SPA and Browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.

      "body": "Problem You are using the Browser Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the Browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The Browser product attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect.

Tip To use SPA and browser monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Prerequisites In order to deploy SPA monitoring, you must: Make sure your app and Browser agent version meet New Relic's compatibility and requirements. Agree to the Terms of Service, which automatically appears during the setup process for the first app you select for your account. By agreeing to the Terms, you authorize New Relic to collect hash fragments from URLs. You only need to select the checkbox option once for your account. Enable SPA monitoring To deploy SPA monitoring for your app, you must already have a Pro subscription. Then, you must enable Pro + SPA monitoring, and deploy a new JavaScript snippet that includes SPA monitoring. Tip The bottom of the generated JavaScript snippet includes your Browser license key and application ID. This is useful, for example, when using the New Relic REST API (v2) or API Explorer. To enable SPA monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, then select Pro + SPA. Agree to the Terms of Service. Select Save application settings. Deploy the new JavaScript snippet using the same method you used when you originally deployed Browser for your app: If you deploy Browser with the copy/paste method: Copy the entire JavaScript code snippet. Paste it as close to the top of the HEAD of your webpage as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). If you deploy using an APM agent: If possible, restart your app and clear the server-side cache to ensure the APM agent picks up the change and deploys the new JavaScript snippet. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for Browser to start receiving SPA monitoring data. To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. If SPA data does not start to appear in the Page views page after a few minutes, see Browser's troubleshooting procedures. Disable SPA monitoring To opt out of our SPA monitoring feature: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Select a different agent version/loader option.

      "body": "Problem You are using the Browser Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the Browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The Browser product attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.

Single-page app (SPA) data To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Initial page loads and route changes are automatically grouped by Browser Interaction Name. You can adjust this with your allow list settings for segments. If you set custom route names with the SPA API, the custom route names will be displayed. You can change how the page loads and route changes are grouped by using the Group page by dropdown. By default, the list of page loads and route changes displays the most time consuming views at the top of the list. You can also sort by average response time, median response time, and throughput per minute by using the Sort by dropdown. To search for specific views by grouped URL, type in the search bar below the Sort by dropdown. For example, to find URLs that represent your checkout page, search for checkout. The charts on the initial Page view page display: The five views with the slowest average response times The five views with the highest throughput To change the range of time being examined, use the time picker near the top of the page. (If you choose a time range more than eight days in the past, some filtering and grouping functionality won't be available.) Filter SPA views one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > Filter: Use the Filter to filter for route changes, initial page loads, and other attributes like location and browser type. To view only initial page loads or only route changes, use the Filter dropdown. For example, to view only route changes, select Filter > Route change. The filter also gives you the ability to filter by other attributes of page loads and route changes, such as app name, geographical location of the browser, and browser type. For example, to see only page loads and route changes that occurred on browsers in the city of Portland, Oregon, select Filter > City > Portland. Group SPA views You can use the Group page by dropdown to group the list of page views by any attribute. For example, if you want to compare the average response times by browser type, select Group page by > userAgent. The combination of filtering and grouping lets you quickly find very specific data. For example, to compare how a specific URL is loading on different browsers: From the Filter dropdown, select targetURL, then select the URL you want to study. From the Group page by dropdown, select userAgent. SPA view details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > (select a view): Select a view from the list to see assorted details and breakdowns. Select an individual page load or route change to see details. Selecting either will provide a breakdown of where time was spent for a browser interaction, and display that data over a time series matching the window selected in the time picker. Every route change view can theoretically also be an initial page load. (For example, when a route change URL is sent to someone else and they load it, that will now be considered an initial page load to New Relic.) This is why the SPA view details page has charts for both initial page loads and route changes. This allows you to compare how a view performs as an initial page load to how its performance as a route change. There are three chart display options, selectable with the icons to the right of the Avg initial page load time chart title. The default display is the color-coded stacked area chart. You can also switch to a Histogram display or a percentile line graph. Also on the details page is a Throughput chart that combines initial page loads and route changes. The chart displays the 5 pages with the highest throughput, which are listed beneath the chart, and consolidates all other pages into Other. Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line represents when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by New Relic Browser without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical Performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical Performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "This document explains how Browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the Browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the Browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, Browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, Browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the Browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for Browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line represents when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by New Relic Browser without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical Performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical Performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "This document explains how Browser collects and stores your asynchronous single page app (SPA) data. This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the Browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the Browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, Browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, Browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the Browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for Browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. For more on product-specific pricing: see the APM pricing and Infrastructure pricing pages. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown.

Features New Relic's integration for Amazon Elastic Classic Load Balancing (ELB) reports ELB data, including HTTP code message counts, healthy and unhealthy host counts, latency times, and ELB configuration states. AWS integration data is also available for querying and chart creation in New Relic One. Amazon offers three types of load balancers: Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Network Load Balancer (NLB). New Relic also offers an ALB/NLB integration to monitor the last two types of load balancers. Activate integration To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the AWS ELB integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute View and use data To view and use this integration's data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the ELB integration links. You can query and explore your data using the LoadBalancerSample event type, with a provider value of Elb. Metric data The integration collects the following metrics. For additional details about these metrics, see Amazon's ELB Classic Load Balancer metrics documentation. Name Description backendConnectionErrors.Sum Rate of the number of connections per second that were not successfully established between the load balancer and the registered instances. The load balancer retries the connection when there are errors, so this count may exceed the request rate. This count also includes any connection errors related to health checks. healthyHostCount unHealthyHostCount The number of healthy or unhealthy instances registered with your load balancer. A newly registered instance is considered healthy after it passes the first health check. If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the number of healthy instances for the LoadBalancerName dimension is calculated across all availability zones. Otherwise, it is calculated per availability zone. httpCodeBackend2XX httpCodeBackend3XX httpCodeBackend4XX httpCodeBackend5XX [ HTTP listener] The number of HTTP response codes generated per second by registered instances. This count does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer. httpCodeElb4XX [ HTTP listener] The number of HTTP 4XX client error codes generated by the load balancer per minute. Client errors are generated when a request is malformed or incomplete. httpCodeElb5XX [ HTTP listener] The number of HTTP 5XX server error codes generated by the load balancer per minute. This count does not include any response codes generated by the registered instances. The metric is reported if there are no healthy instances registered to the load balancer, or if the request rate exceeds the capacity of the instances (spillover) or the load balancer. latency.Average latency.Maximum [ HTTP listener] The total time elapsed, in seconds, from the time the load balancer sent the request to a registered instance until the instance started to send the response headers. [ TCP listener] The total time elapsed, in seconds, for the load balancer to successfully establish a connection to a registered instance. Available statistics: aws.elb.latency.p90 aws.elb.latency.p95 aws.elb.latency.p99 requestCount The number of requests completed or connections made per second during the specified interval (1 or 5 minutes). spilloverCount The total number of requests that were rejected per second, due to the surge queue being full. surgeQueueLength.Average, Maximum, Minimum The total number of requests that are pending routing. The load balancer queues a request if it is unable to establish a connection with a healthy instance in order to route the request. The maximum size of the queue is 1,024. Additional requests are rejected when the queue is full. For more information, see SpilloverCount. estimatedAlbActiveConnectionCount.Average, Maximum, Minimum The estimated number of concurrent TCP connections active from clients to the load balancer and from the load balancer to targets. estimatedAlbConsumedLcus.Average, Maximum, Minimum The estimated number of load balancer capacity units (LCU) used by an application load balancer. estimatedAlbNewConnectionCount.Average, Maximum, Minimum The estimated number of new TCP connections established from clients to the load balancer and from the load balancer to targets. estimatedProcessedBytes.Average, Maximum, Minimum The estimated number of bytes processed by an application load balancer. Inventory data The following configuration options are available with the New Relic Amazon ELB integration. Name Description availabilityZone Lists one or more availability zones from the same region as the load balancer. awsRegion The AWS region that the load balancer runs in. canonicalHostedZoneNameId The ID of the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone name associated with the load balancer. canonicalHostedZoneName The name of the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone that is associated with the load balancer. If you specify internal for the Elastic Load Balancing scheme, use DNSNameinstead. For an internal scheme, the load balancer doesn't have a CanonicalHostedZoneName value. createdTime Timestamp with the date and time the load balancer was created. dnsName The public DNS name of the load balancer. instances A JSON string representing the list of IDs of EC2 instances associated with the load balancer. listeners A JSON string representing the list of Listeners associated with the load balancer. loadBalancerName The name of the load balancer. scheme For load balancers attached to an Amazon VPC, this parameter can be used to specify the type of load balancer to use. For more information, see the AWS ElasticLoadBalancing documentation about LoadBalancer properties. securityGroups A JSON string representing the list of security groups assigned to your load balancer within your virtual private cloud (VPC). sourceSecurityGroup The security group that you can use as part of your inbound rules for your load balancer's back-end Amazon EC2 application instances. subnets A JSON string representing the list of subnet IDs in your virtual private cloud (VPC) to attach to your load balancer. Do not specify multiple subnets that are in the same Availability Zone. You can specify the AvailabilityZones or Subnets property, but not both. vpcId The ID of the VPC that the load balancer has been configured in. Child inventory data Tip Data indicated with an asterisk * is only fetched if extended inventory collection is on. Name Description accessLog/enabled * A boolean. If true, access logs are enabled for this load balancer. connectionDraining/enabled * A boolean. Use connection draining to ensure that a Classic Load Balancer does not send requests to unhealthy instances. For more information, see the AWS documentation to configure connection draining for your Classic Load Balancer. connectionDraining/timeout * The number of seconds the load balancer waits before forcibly closing connections to the de-registering instance. Valid values are 1 to 3600. connectionSettings/idleTimeout * For more information, see the AWS documentation to configure the idle connection timeout for your Classic Load Balancer. crossZoneLoadBalancing/enabled * A boolean. For more information, see the AWS documentation to configure cross-zone load balancing for your Classic Load Balancer. healthCheck/healthyThreshold The number of consecutive successful health checks that must occur before declaring an EC2 instance healthy. Valid values: 2 to 10. healthCheck/interval The amount of time in seconds between health checks of an individual instance. Valid values: 5 to 300. healthCheck/target Combination of three properties: The protocol to use to connect with the instance. Valid values: TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL. The port to use to connect with the instance, as a protocol:port pair. If the load balancer fails to connect with the instance at the specified port within the configured response timeout period, the instance is considered unhealthy. The destination for the HTTP or HTTPS request. healthCheck/timeout The amount of time in seconds to wait when receiving a response from the health check. Valid values: 2 to 60. healthCheck/unhealthyThreshold The number of consecutive failed health checks that must occur before declaring an EC2 instance unhealthy. Valid values: 2 to 10. policies/otherPolicies JSON string representing security policies associated with this load balancer.",

      "body": "There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

The Go language integration-building tutorial on GitHub gives step-by-step procedures for building a Go language integration that reports Redis data. The tutorial shows how to build an integration using the Linux command line, but you can use the same techniques for a Windows integration with a standard Go install and PowerShell. The make command will not work with PowerShell, but you can use the Go commands inside it as a guide for building your integration. Tip You can create an on-host integration in any language, but Go is the language New Relic uses for its own integrations and build tools. To create an integration in another language, adhere to the integration file structures and JSON output requirements. Go language integration building package The tutorial relies on a New Relic Go language integration-building library package, which provides a set of useful Go functions and data structures. The package gives you tools that: Generate a \"scaffold\" integration structure with all the required fields. Read values from command-line arguments or environment variables.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "Problem You created a custom New Relic Infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the Infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the Infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure provides an SDK for creating an on-host integration. This document explains requirements and best practices for generating integration logs. Logging requirements It's up to the integration creator to decide what kind of log messages to create, and what kind of information will be useful for debugging issues. There is only one requirement for how an integration must generate logs: The integration executable must write logs to standard error (stderr). The Infrastructure agent will capture lines written to standard error and merge them into the logging stream written by the Infrastructure agent itself. To avoid depending on third-party logging solutions, the Go integration building library provides a simple log package with the common log-levels. Recommendations and best practices Here are the recommended practices for generating integration logs: By default, an integration should be \"quiet.\" Aside from the data emitted to standard output, there should be very few logging or diagnostic messages generated. It's recommended you include a verbose logging mode similar to the verbose setting in the Infrastructure agent. Include a command line switch to enable and disable verbose logging (for example, -verbose). To debug your integration while the integration is running, include the verbose switch in the definition file as part of the command line to be run. This will send the verbose logs to the Infrastructure agent's own log file. For general debugging purposes, New Relic recommends you use a flag that writes the standard out JSON data in human-readable \"pretty-printed\" form (for example, --pretty). Note that output written in a \"pretty-printed\" form is only for your debugging purposes and is not compatible with the Infrastructure agent. Your integration should be created so that it can run on its own. If in doubt whether the integration is communicating with the Infrastructure agent, you can run the integration from the command line and see if it's producing the correct output or log messages you expect. For information about the Go language logging package, see Logging package. For more help For logging for all New Relic agents, see New Relic agent logs and troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing plan require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing plan have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI To set high security in the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. If you are on our original pricing plan, only the account owner can view this option. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API allows you to create and manage dashboards. Important Note that this API will be permanently deprecated between July 28 - August 30, 2021. Firstly, on July 28 the list and show endpoints and then on August 30 the rest of endpoints. We have a migration guide to help you transition to using the new dashboards API. For instructions on using the UI, see Dashboards. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. For detailed examples and use cases, see this New Relic blog post. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "If your organization has strict requirements about Content Security Policy (CSP) v2, you may need to host the New Relic Browser agent in order to properly install and run it. For example, if the New Relic domain hosting the Browser agent is being blocked by your website, you may see an error similar to this: Browser agent.js is unable to run because it violates the following Content Security Protocol directive: script-src = *.google.com other URLs Copy In this situation, you must copy and paste the agent's JavaScript code and self-host it as a .js file. This allows the page to reference the .js file during page load. Contents Requirements In order to host the Browser agent with your app, make sure you follow these requirements: CSP and Browser agent Requirements Application or platform Your app or platform where your site is hosted must meet New Relic Browser's standard compatibility requirements. Exception: CSP restrictions prevent you from linking an APM app for Browser monitoring. Subscription You must have a Pro+SPA Browser subscription for your app. Host location for domains The .js file for New Relic Browser must be hosted on a highly available or replicated location, such as a CDN or distributed network. This helps ensure performance is not affected. If you see error messages, add New Relic Browser domains to your CSP whitelist. If you want New Relic Browser to monitor Salesforce Lightning pages, follow the Salesforce procedures to add New Relic Browser domains to your CSP whitelist. By hosting the agent, you are responsible for any performance impact on the location where the agent is hosted. Browser agent version Your selected app must use the latest Browser agent version. 1. Whitelist New Relic Browser domains Follow your organization's standard procedures to request a CSP exception. Then add both of these New Relic Browser domains to your CSP whitelist: https://js-agent.newrelic.com: This is where the New Relic Browser agent is hosted. The Browser agent download requires three files to run. Two are downloaded after the initial agent is run to continue capturing performance data. https://bam.nr-data.net: This is the endpoint where the New Relic Browser agent receives data from your site. Here is example HTML to add to the head of your site: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://js-agent.newrelic.com https://bam.nr-data.net Copy 2. Copy Browser app's JS snippet To create and host a .js file, you must first copy the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet from the hosting app. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Browser. From the list of Browser apps, select the app for which you want to self-host the Browser agent. Select Settings > Application settings > Copy/paste JavaScript code. Copy the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet. Save and exit the Browser app's Application settings page. Continue with the procedures to create a .js file for your page. 3. Create .js file for page After you copy the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet from the selected Browser app: Open a text editor and paste the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet. Delete the first line (<script type=\"text/javascript\">) and the last line of the JavaScript snippet (</script>). Save the text file as nr-spa-VERSION_NUMBER.min.js, where VERSION_NUMBER is the latest Browser agent version. Reference the .js file in the <head> of your webpage. After you install the Browser agent's JavaScript snippet, you can use the New Relic Browser UI to monitor website performance.",

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, see Use Browser SPA agent. To add a fully instrumented app, go to one.newrelic.com, and click the Add more data button on the top right hand-side. Then, use the guided install to start monitoring your app. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > POST Create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a Browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your apps in New Relic Browser, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific Browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by Browser application ID: To view a specific Browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your Browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, see Use Browser SPA agent. To add a fully instrumented app, go to one.newrelic.com, and click the Add more data button on the top right hand-side. Then, use the guided install to start monitoring your app. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > POST Create.

App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your apps in New Relic Browser, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List.

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. With distributed tracing data, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues and fix them. Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests go from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request. Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace. Why it matters A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these. For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers: The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request. None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. What you can see in the New Relic UI After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data: What you can do Description Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Customize queries and dashboards You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards. See data across accounts See a global view of traces from across all your accounts and applications in New Relic One.

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request. Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace. Why it matters A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these. For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers: The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request. None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. What you can see in the New Relic UI After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data: What you can do Description Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Customize queries and dashboards You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards.

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Important Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 8 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 8 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Step 3 of 8 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 8 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 8 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: bash Copy $ cd ../.. Step 6 of 8 If this is your first time executing this code run the below command to install all the required modules: bash Copy $ npm install Step 7 of 8 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Important If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Important In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application.

This document contains: Benefits of this feature Requirements Enable distributed tracing Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) Find and query data Troubleshooting Tip Browser data is available in standard distributed tracing only, not Infinite Tracing. Benefits of browser data in distributed tracing By enabling New Relic to report browser data to distributed tracing, you can see the connection between front-end activity and back-end activity. You can see across a full transaction, from time spent by an end user in the web browser, to network activity, to associated back-end services. Benefits of this feature: Quickly spot latencies, errors, and anomalies in the browser or network Resolve customer-facing problems more quickly All the benefits of distributed tracing applied to your end-user monitoring Requirements and compatibility This feature reports AJAX requests (Fetch and XHR) that occur during a browser interaction. By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the minimum versions for your Browser, APM, and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for Browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure Browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste Browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. With distributed tracing data, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues and fix them. Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests go from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request. Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace. Why it matters A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these. For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers: The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request. None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. What you can see in the New Relic UI After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data: What you can do Description Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Customize queries and dashboards You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace.

Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query.

Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits).

Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy Mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Leverage our metric-based alerts and New Relic Mobile UI. Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the Mobile UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if monitored by New Relic Browser), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. New Relic Mobile tracks the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags.. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, apps monitored by New Relic APM or New Relic Browser, hosts monitored by New Relic Infrastructure, and so on) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Leverage our metric-based alerts and New Relic Mobile UI. Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the Mobile UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if monitored by New Relic Browser), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. New Relic Mobile tracks the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Leverage our metric-based alerts and New Relic Mobile UI. Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the Mobile UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if monitored by New Relic Browser), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. New Relic Mobile tracks the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "The New Relic Kubernetes events integration watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. To visualize your event data, use the Kubernetes cluster explorer in New Relic One platform, or use the infrastructure events UI. Requirements The Kubernetes events integration requires you to: Install and activate the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Configure a Kubernetes pod with the label app.kubernetes.io/name=nri-kube-events and two containers, one used to capture events in the Kubernetes cluster and the other to forward the events to New Relic. Install the Kubernetes events integration Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. To install the New Relic Kubernetes events integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest YAML file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-kube-events-latest.yaml manifest file, adding both a cluster name, to identify your Kubernetes cluster (required), and your New Relic license key (required). clusterName: \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" [...] - name: \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" value: \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-kube-events-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then go to one.newrelic.com > Query builder, and run the following NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy View your Kubernetes events Once you have successfully installed the Kubernetes event integration, you can view and query your events in New Relic. To add events to your New Relic One dashboard: Add a chart to a new or existing dashboard or create a chart using the New Relic query builder. When creating or updating your chart, select the chart type table and use the following event query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind,event.involvedObject.name,event.reason,event.message WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' limit 100 Copy Query events Here are a few examples to query your data: Get attributes names To see all the attributes names, use the following query: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT keyset() WHERE category = 'kubernetes' Copy See event details To see details about the latest events in a cluster, use the following query, replacing YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster: FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT event.involvedObject.kind, event.involvedObject.name, event.type, event.message, event.reason WHERE category = 'kubernetes' AND clusterName='YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME'​ Copy The events collected by New Relic will have the exact same attributes as given by Kubernetes. For a reference of these attributes, see the Kubernetes event v1 core documentation. Search events in New Relic To search events in the New Relic Infrastructure UI: Navigate to the Infrastructure event page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Events. In Category, select kubernetes. Use the Search events field to look for specific events. To focus on a specific set of events, select or change the filter set. View events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer To view events in the Kubernetes cluster explorer, use either of these methods: In New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer. Then, to view the pod details: In the Kubernetes cluster explorer, select a pod. Select Show pod events. Optional: Collect metrics of the event collector To collect metric data for the event collector itself, install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. To get started: Install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Label the deployment of your Kubernetes events integration with your configured scrape label (default is prometheus.io/scrape=true). Optional: Define custom attributes To add custom attributes to the events sent by the integration these need to be specified as environment variables following the nomenclature NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_attributeKey=attributeValue. These environment variables should be defined as part of the spec for the kube-events container. For example, to add the attribute environment with value staging to all the events, add the following to your manifest: env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Be sure to specify the environment in the spec for the kube-events container, making your manifest look something like this: ... kind: Deployment ... spec: ... template: ... spec: containers: - name: kube-events ... env: - name: NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment value: dev Copy Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips when using the Kubernetes events integration. Get logs on event collection To check the logs of our event collector: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events kube-events Copy To add more details, enable verbose mode by adding verbose: \"true\" in the config section of you configuration file, either before or after the clusterName. Get logs on sending events To check the logs of the agent responsible for sending the events to New Relic: kubectl logs deploy/nr-kube-events infra-agent Copy",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Leverage our metric-based alerts and New Relic Mobile UI. Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the Mobile UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if monitored by New Relic Browser), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. New Relic Mobile tracks the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Get notified Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on how to set up notification channels. Correlate your incidents In addition to notifications, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents. See our docs on how to correlate incidents using decisions. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Tip Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can also set PagerDuty as a destination, as well as any other destination compatible with webhook: Send data to PagerDuty Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your Amazon API Gateway data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported. Features Amazon's API Gateway is a fully managed service that allows you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With the New Relic API Gateway integration, you get more data about how your API layer is working behind the scenes. You'll receive metric data about the number of API calls, the requests served, the number of errors, latency counts, and more. You can monitor and alert on your API Gateway data directly from New Relic, and query data and create dashboards. Requirements API Gateway will not send \"Call count by resource\", \"4xx error by resource\" and \"5xx errors by resource\" metrics unless you have explicitly enabled detailed CloudWatch metrics. Tip Enabling these metrics may add additional charges to your Amazon CloudWatch account pricing. To enable CloudWatch metrics, use either of these options: Go to the AWS Management Console, select the Settings option for CloudWatch, then select the option to enable detailed CloudWatch metrics. Call the stage:update action of the Amazon API Gateway REST API to update the metricsEnabled property to true. Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon API gateway integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the API Gateway integration links. You can query and explore your data using the ApiGatewaySample event type. For more on how to use your data, see Understand and use integration data. Metric data This New Relic infrastructure integration collects the following Amazon API Gateway data: Metric Description 4XXError The number of client-side errors captured 5XXError The number of server-side errors captured. CacheHitCount The number of requests served from the API cache. CacheMissCount The number of requests served from the back end when API caching is enabled. Count The number of calls to API methods. IntegrationLatency The time in milliseconds between when API Gateway relays a request to the back end and when it receives a response from the back end. Latency The time in milliseconds between when API Gateway receives a request from a client and when it returns a response to the client. The latency includes the integration latency and other API Gateway overhead. Inventory data Inventory data provides information about the service's state and configuration. API Gateway configuration options are reported as inventory data. For more about inventory data, see Understand and use data.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": .

To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Problem The New Relic infrastructure agent is consuming too much CPU. Solution The New Relic infrastructure agent is designed to report a broad range of system data with minimal CPU and memory consumption. However, if you have a need to reduce your CPU consumption, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency of various samplers and plugins. This topic highlights some newrelic-infra.yml configurations that may reduce your CPU usage: Reduce event sampling Reduce agent plugin reporting Review on-host integrations Reduce event sampling The infrastructure agent reports several default events at specific frequencies. To lower the overhead, you can reduce the sampling frequency in seconds, or you can completely disable the samplers by setting the corresponding property value to -1. Important We don't recommend a sample rate larger than 60 seconds because you may see gaps in the New Relic user interface charts. The table below lists some samplers to configure: Event Sampling frequency Allow/deny list Network Network sampling rate Not available Process Process sampling rate Allow list (Windows only) Storage Storage sampling rate Deny list System System sampling rate Not available Reduce agent plugin reporting The infrastructure agent has built-in plugins that collect inventory data (specific system configuration and state information). For some systems, the CPU consumption may be relatively high if the plugins are gathering a lot of data. To reduce the footprint, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency for specific plugins that report data you don’t want. How to enable and disable plugins Disable a single plugin: To disable a plugin, set the corresponding property value to -1. Disable all plugins: disable_all_plugins: true Enable selected plugins: To enable certain plugins, insert an exception in disable_all_plugins. For example, the following configuration disables all plugins, but the Network Interfaces plugin reports every 120 seconds: disable_all_plugins: true network_interface_interval_sec: 120 Copy Disable SELinux semodule -l (Linux only) The SELinux plugin periodically invokes the semodule -l system command to get information about the existing SELinux modules. In most CentOS/RedHat distributions, this command will generate CPU consumption peaks. To disable this functionality, insert the following configuration option in your /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file: selinux_enable_semodule: false Reduce or disable Sysctl (Linux only) The Sysctl plugin walks the whole /sys directory structure and reads values from all the files there. Disabling it or reducing the interval may decrease some CPU System time in the Infrastructure agent. You can disable inventory frequency by setting it to a negative number or reduce the frequeny by setting the sysctl_interval_sec configuration value to the number of seconds between consecutive executions of the plugin. For example, to execute the plugin once every 10 minutes: sysctl_interval_sec: 600 Copy To disable the Sysctl plugin: sysctl_interval_sec: -1 Copy The current default value for the sysctl_interval_sec property is 60. Additional plugins to reduce or disable The following inventory plugins are not especially CPU consuming, but you can still reduce their frequency or disable them by setting the corresponding configuration options.

The nature of the impact and the methods to adjust the impact depend on the integration you're using. Here are some ways to adjust on-host integration CPU usage: See if your integration has configuration options you can adjust.

If you do not see this APM-Infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see New Relic APM data in Infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (e.g. newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz) maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is logged. Once an error has been logged, the cached debug messages are logged, but only the most recent number of configured debug messages. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, after an error is logged, only the 10 most recent debug messages are logged, and older logs are discarded. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

      "body": "Use the Hosts page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart.

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Update your license key in config_defaults.sh. Optional: Update any other environment parameters in the configuration file. Execute installer.sh with admin rights. The script automatically identifies your service manager. If it fails, it will prompt you to manually update it. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. See our docs for more information. Configure your installation The configuration file config_defaults.sh serves as a source of reference for all the configuration options. It contains the following environment parameters: Variable Description NRIA_AGENT_DIR Required at agent startup. The agent home directory. Default: /var/db/newrelic-infra/ Copy NRIA_BIN_DIR Required at installation. The path to the agent binary folder. Default: /usr/local/bin Copy NRIA_CONFIG_FILE Required at installation. The agent configuration file's location. Default: /etc/newrelic-infra/yml Copy NRIA_LICENSE_KEY Only configuration option required at startup. The infrastructure agent license key. NRIA_LOG_FILE Required at agent startup. The location where the agent will log. Default: /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log Copy NRIA_MODE Required at installation. The privilege level for the agent. Possible values are ROOT, PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED. For more info see our documentation on agent running modes. Default: ROOT Copy NRIA_PID_FILE Required at agent startup. The location where the agent will place its PID file. Default: /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid Copy NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR Required at agent startup. The directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Default: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy NRIA_USER Required at installation time only when the running mode is set to either PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED. The user that will run the agent binary. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions. Here are some examples: Apache Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-apache yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-apache zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-apache Cassandra Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-cassandra yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-cassandra zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-cassandra Kubernetes Each cluster will have a single node where kubectl is running. To uninstall the Kubernetes integration, use the following command on each of these nodes: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy MySQL Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-mysql yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-mysql zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-mysql NGINX Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-nginx yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-nginx zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-nginx Redis Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove nri-redis yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove nri-redis zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove nri-redis StatsD cd /path/to/statsd npm uninstall @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend From the StatsD config.js, remove the \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" entry from the list of backends. Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions. To replicate the integrations package, you will need to install all the available integrations again.",

Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

Let's look at how the APM-Infrastructure integration works and how to make use of the shared data. The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on Infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between Infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set. If you do not see APM data in infrastructure monitoring, see Troubleshooting.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

Let's look at how the APM-Infrastructure integration works and how to make use of the shared data. The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on Infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between Infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set. If you do not see APM data in infrastructure monitoring, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

Let's look at how the APM-Infrastructure integration works and how to make use of the shared data. The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on Infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between Infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set. If you do not see APM data in infrastructure monitoring, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can combine filters into a filter set to organize hosts based on criteria that matter the most to you. Read on to learn about the benefits, use, and logic of filter sets. Benefits of filter sets You can create filter sets using available attributes or tags. For example, you can organize your infrastructure into categories such as: Regions Operating system versions Hosts associated with Docker containers Test environments You can share filter sets with other people in your account, and you can quickly identify infrastructure problems by checking the color-coded health status of each host in the filter set. Create filter sets The default infrastructure filter set is All hosts, and it serves as a template for you to create filter sets. To create a filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. If All hosts is not displayed in the left sidebar, open that filter set by selecting Saved filter sets > All hosts. In All hosts, click Filter hosts. In the list, click an item to see a list of values. Click Include or Exclude (see Filter set logic). Click values individually or enter text to match multiple values. Continue adding filters until you have the filter set you want. To name your filter, click the icon, type a name, and click Save. Edit filter sets To change an existing filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. In the sidebar, click an option to update your filter set, and then save. Delete filter sets You can delete any saved filter set except the default All hosts. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Filter sets. Click to delete the filter set. Combine filter sets with grouping On some pages you can use Group by to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, on the Hosts page, you can group by awsRegion to display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage. Grouping applies to the selected filter sets. By combining filter sets with grouping, you can find detailed system information quickly. For an example of using these tools to troubleshoot a problem, see Combining filter sets and grouping. Copy filters from filter set to alerts When you create an alert condition, you can build filters individually, or you can copy all the filters from a filter set into a new alert condition. This is a quick shortcut to populate a new alert condition with some filters. Important When you copy filter set filters to a new alert condition, these filters are no longer tied to the filter set. If you make changes to the filter set, the alert filters are not affected. To copy filter set filters to a new alert condition: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. Mouse over any chart and click > Create alert. Enter an alert condition name. Make adjustments to filters as necessary. Complete the remaining alert fields (see Create alert conditions). Filter set logic When you create a filter set, you generate a list of attributes and/or tags that narrow the results. This section explains how filter sets apply various rules to the list. Inclusion and exclusion As part of building a filter set, you designate whether a filter should include or exclude entities that match certain values. The way the inclusion or exclusion works depends on how you select values: Recommended: Select values by matching a string You can generate a list of values by entering a string that you want values to match. This is useful for matching multiple values. Tip String matching efficiently generates a list of values, and this approach scales as you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with string matching: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator LIKE, which means the results include any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term East-, and all entities that contain that term are returned. Exclude If you click Exclude and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator NOT LIKE, which means the results exclude any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term West-, and all entities that do not contain that term are returned. Select values individually You can click through the list of attributes/tags to identify individual values. Tip This approach does not scale well if you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with individual value selection: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then click specific values, the filter uses the comparator IN, which means the filter looks for entities that exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. Exclude If you click Exclude and then click specific values, the filter set uses the comparator NOT IN, which means the filter returns all entities that do not exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. And/Or Filter sets use the logical operators AND and OR behind the scenes to join the data. Here are the rules for AND and OR: When you click values from multiple attributes or tags, they are joined by AND. When you click values from within an attribute or tags, they are joined by OR. The filter results display hosts for which both of the following are true: Hosts containing any one of the selected infrastructure agent versions Hosts in any one of the selected AWS availability zones",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

To create an alerts condition from any chart, select the ellipses icon and then Create alert. New Relic will automatically select the appropriate Alert type. Example Problem and solution High CPU usage Problem: Your Ops team monitors a filtered set of host clusters in your eastern region and notices that the CPU usage is constantly high. Solution: Use the CPU chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Hosts page to create an alert condition for system metrics. Virtual memory capacity Problem: Your night shift needs to be alerted when virtual memory for a set of background workers reaches an average of 10G for at least two minutes. Solution: Use the Top memory consumers chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Processes page to create an alert condition for process metrics. Limited bandwidth Problem: You want to monitor performance based on the average number of errors received or transmitted.

REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information.

This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.
