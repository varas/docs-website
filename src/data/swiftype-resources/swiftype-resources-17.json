Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). The title is also shown in the sidebar. Try to keep your titles as short as possible. The title will automatically be converted to a file name, lower case, punctuation removed, with dashes between words. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page.

Document body The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content. Page templates For most situations, use the basicDoc page template. Read on for information about our other page templates. Content type Description Basic page A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site. API doc This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see apiStyleGuidelines (for style guidelines) and Work with the API doc content type (for how to use and configure). Attribute definition This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service.

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

If you need to change a title or a redirect, create a GitHub issue or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel.

For example, this is the filename and path for Rename or redirect a document: /docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document.mdx Copy The URL is: https://docs.newrelic.com/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document Copy If you rename a document's filename or change its path by moving it to a new directory, make sure to add a redirect to its old filepath. To change the document's location in the left navigation, update the navigation configuration file. Change titles To change a document title, change the title being used in the title field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc. If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the yml file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use /src/nav/style-guide.yml. Change anchor links Wherever possible, do not change the [#anchor_ids] of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor id is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs. Edit redirects If you change the URL of a doc, make sure you add the old URL to the redirects frontmatter section at the top of the doc.",

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: New Relic APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents.

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Procedures are the same for both standard docs (\"basic pages\") and release notes. Caution Changing titles or updating redirects can create issues with finding content. If you need to change a title or a redirect, create a GitHub issue or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel. URL format A document's URL is based on its filename and filepath in the GitHub repository. For example, this is the filename and path for Rename or redirect a document: /docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document.mdx Copy The URL is: https://docs.newrelic.com/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document Copy If you rename a document's filename or change its path by moving it to a new directory, make sure to add a redirect to its old filepath. To change the document's location in the left navigation, update the navigation configuration file. Change titles To change a document title, change the title being used in the title field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc. If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the yml file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use /src/nav/style-guide.yml. Change anchor links Wherever possible, do not change the [#anchor_ids] of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor id is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs. Edit redirects If you change the URL of a doc, make sure you add the old URL to the redirects frontmatter section at the top of the doc.",

Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Explaining where to find UI pages and elements can be tricky. When done well, path descriptions can make navigating our UI easier for readers. Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

      "body": "Our five questions form the core of how our Tech Docs team thinks about writing excellent technical documentation. Informally, we call these our 5Qs. Anyone can contribute to our Docs site. We want you to feel confident and proud that your contributions provide valuable content and quality. We also want our readers to trust and easily use the information in our docs. To help you plan, write, and edit excellent docs, ask yourself the questions in this doc. There's really only 1Q The 5Qs exist to help answer one question. Whenever you write a doc, ask yourself: What problem are we trying to solve? It's critical you know what you're trying to do and why that goal matters to your readers. Asking the five questions (and the sub-questions!) will help you ensure you're building the right thing. 5Qs and sub-questions Each of the five questions includes sub-questions to help guide your thinking. 1. Did you use or observe the thing you are writing about? Think about who your audience is and the level of complexity they need. End users' point of view Ask yourself: Audience Do you know who is reading your document (dev/ops teams, support personnel, non-technical staff, etc.)? Can you articulate what this thing is (feature, procedure) and why it matters to our customers? For conceptual info, did you interview multiple stakeholders? Testing Put yourself in the user's shoes. For example: Did you use the thing on your own? Did you watch a subject matter expert use the thing? If you can't do it on your own or observe, did you send the draft to at least three SMEs? Before publishing Did you compare the final version of your text against the thing you're writing about? 2. Is this the best place to put this information? Think about where this information belongs. Where does this information belong? Ask yourself: What problem are you trying to solve? Is text always the best answer? Does this doc need to exist at all? For example: Are we duplicating content from somewhere else in the Docs site? Are we duplicating content already in the UI? Could customers have a better experience if we modified the UI design or copy instead of creating a doc? Would another web property be a better home for this information? For example: The Explorers Hub? NRU course? NRU video embedded into the doc? The public New Relic blog? The public New Relic website? 3. Can readers tell in ten seconds if they are in the right place? Think about what the content is and what you can do to make the information easy to skim to find information. Can users skim to find information? Ask yourself: Title and headings Does the title accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the headings accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the title and headings use words the way your readers do? Do the title and headings avoid New Relic jargon? Structure Does the overall structure of the doc help readers find what they're looking for? Is the doc trying to address too many topics? When you glance at the doc, do you see short paragraphs, short sentences, and other visual aids? Or do you see a dense wall of text? Introduction Does the intro give a concise synopsis of what's in the doc? Does the intro give readers an alternate path if they're in the wrong place? 4. Is the information in the best possible format? Think about how to present the information visually. Presentation of information Ask yourself: Visual formats Did you use visual formats appropriately? Would a screenshot make any of the information easier to understand? Does your image caption clearly explain what matters so that the user does not necessarily even need to read the surrounding text? Would a diagram make any of the information easier to understand? Is there a video we could embed to make things clearer? Can step-by-step UI procedures be replaced with a \"show me\" video? Procedures Are your procedures well-structured? Do step-by-step UI procedures even need to be documented? Did you limit the procedural text to action steps and omit detailed explanatory text or edge cases? If detailed explanations need to enhance a procedure, have you organized the info in a way that expert users can skip the details? Text flow Read your draft more than once. Is the documentation direct and to the point? Did you use bullets, tables, or clamshells to improve flow? 5. Is the language approachable, expert, and visionary? Think about why the information matters and why readers will trust and use it. For tips to make it easier for users to read, understand, and use documentation, go to plainlanguage.gov. Also, if you are a New Relic employee, we encourage you to review the corporate brand guidelines. For more information, contact Marketing. Effective language Ask yourself: Readers' point of view Did you tell users why as well as how? Can you articulate not only what this thing is (feature, procedure) and also why it matters to our customers? Did you include useful examples or use cases? Did you include information about relationships this feature has to other New Relic platform tools? Style guide resources Did you follow our style guide? Did you use our edit checklist? Did you use pronouns, contractions, and a conversational tone throughout? Did you review the usage dictionary and other resources in the style guide to make sure that terms are used correctly? Readability Is the text easy to read? Is the language clear? Do you have to reread any sentences or paragraphs to understand them? If so, can you simplify the wording and sentence structure? Does the doc score 40 or better on the Flesch-Kinkaid reading ease scale? If not, try taking another pass at the prose. But don't chase the Flesch-Kincaid score in itself: we're not out to frustrate ourselves, but to write docs that are a pleasure to read. Where to go from here Did you offer readers a clear \"next step\" in each section? If it is necessary to tell a user not to do something, did you also tell them what to do instead? Is the topic complete? Is the doc actionable?",

The title will automatically be converted to a file name, lower case, punctuation removed, with dashes between words. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Start each topic with a _* on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version. watermark We use watermarks for things like beta content or to show that something is an internal New Relic doc. Commonly used watermarks are: BETA, Legacy, Deprecated, NR ONLY, etc. Watermarks look like large, faded text behind the doc's content. Document body The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content. Page templates For most situations, use the basicDoc page template. Read on for information about our other page templates. Content type Description Basic page A standard HTML webpage without special fields.

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. Replace user data with one of the following snippets: For CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux 1 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/6/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/7/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

For example, this is the filename and path for Rename or redirect a document: /docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document.mdx Copy The URL is: https://docs.newrelic.com/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document Copy If you rename a document's filename or change its path by moving it to a new directory, make sure to add a redirect to its old filepath. To change the document's location in the left navigation, update the navigation configuration file. Change titles To change a document title, change the title being used in the title field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc. If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the yml file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use /src/nav/style-guide.yml. Change anchor links Wherever possible, do not change the [#anchor_ids] of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor id is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs. Edit redirects If you change the URL of a doc, make sure you add the old URL to the redirects frontmatter section at the top of the doc.",

Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

      "body": "Explaining where to find UI pages and elements can be tricky. When done well, path descriptions can make navigating our UI easier for readers. Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

      "body": "Collapsers are expandable elements that hide page content until you trigger it open. We use collapsers to hide content in very long documents, out of consideration for our readers. Each collapser has a title (what we show to readers), but also an id that we use for deep \"anchor\" links to specific collapsers. Here's an example collapser: Collapser 1 This is our first example collapser. Collapser 2 This is our second example collapser. Here are some examples of when to use collapsers in your document. Collapsers are useful for... Example Long lists Here are examples when you have a long list of definitions, such as configuration values, API calls, or parameters: Writing scripted browsers .NET agent configuration Multiple options Here's an example when you have multiple options, such as a procedure with steps that vary depending on your application environment: Collecting PMI metrics. Large code blocks Here's an example when you have a code block that is longer than about one screen height: Writing API tests. Subdividing H2s Here's an example when you want a cleaner substitute for h3 tags when subdividing an h2 header: Installing the PHP agent manually. Unlike an h3, collapsers allow users to see all the options within a section at a glance without having to scroll. Create a collapser To create a collapser, you'll need to use our collapser code. Here's an example of the collapser source: <CollapserGroup> <Collapser id=\"collapser-source\" title=\"Collapser source\" > <dl class=\"collapser-list\"> <dt id=\"collapser-1\">Collapser 1</dt> <dd> <p>This is the first example collapser.</p> </dd> <dt id=\"collapser-2\">Collapser 2</dt> <dd> <p>This is the second example collapser.</p> </dd> </dl> </Collapser> </CollapserGroup> Copy Collapsers triggers To open or close a collapser: Click the open buttons or Show/Hide All. Arrive at an individual collapser via an anchor ID. For example, go directly to Collapser 1 in the example above. Type the shortcut key s to show (open) all collapsers on the page. Use CMD+F (or CTRL+F) to find in page and all the collapsers will open automatically.",

      "body": "You can use this dictionary to guide your writing on docs.newrelic.com. We use this to help ensure consistency across our Docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the Docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta When using as a watermark or in the doc's title, use all caps: <div id=\"watermark\">BETA</div> Copy Don't include a callout within the document unless the beta requires additional explanation. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: <Callout variant=\"important\"> This feature currently is in private beta. To join the beta, contact your New Relic account rep. </Callout> Copy If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right-click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also mouse over. collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation Avoid referring to the document itself (the docs site page) as much as possible. If there's not a good alternative, you can use doc, document, or documentation (whatever sounds most natural; try reading it aloud). For example, This document explains how to... or For related docs, see... dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account The primary account in a New Relic account with sub-accounts. Refer to a master's subordinate accounts as sub-accounts, not children or slaves. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for watermarking docs for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account Don't use. See master account. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of Browser docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for Browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing (in Browser docs) or New Relic Browser (in non-Browser docs). Within Browser docs, use this term only for SEO or clarification, never to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures. However, avoid using generic “you” or “your” when permissions are involved, because we can't assume what permissions the user has. For example, we can't just say “you can add and remove users from your account settings” when that is actually an Owner or Admin level capability. When permissions are relevant, use a permissions callout.",

      "body": "Explaining where to find UI pages and elements can be tricky. When done well, path descriptions can make navigating our UI easier for readers. Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

      "body": "Collapsers are expandable elements that hide page content until you trigger it open. We use collapsers to hide content in very long documents, out of consideration for our readers. Each collapser has a title (what we show to readers), but also an id that we use for deep \"anchor\" links to specific collapsers. Here's an example collapser: Collapser 1 This is our first example collapser. Collapser 2 This is our second example collapser. Here are some examples of when to use collapsers in your document. Collapsers are useful for... Example Long lists Here are examples when you have a long list of definitions, such as configuration values, API calls, or parameters: Writing scripted browsers .NET agent configuration Multiple options Here's an example when you have multiple options, such as a procedure with steps that vary depending on your application environment: Collecting PMI metrics. Large code blocks Here's an example when you have a code block that is longer than about one screen height: Writing API tests. Subdividing H2s Here's an example when you want a cleaner substitute for h3 tags when subdividing an h2 header: Installing the PHP agent manually. Unlike an h3, collapsers allow users to see all the options within a section at a glance without having to scroll. Create a collapser To create a collapser, you'll need to use our collapser code. Here's an example of the collapser source: <CollapserGroup> <Collapser id=\"collapser-source\" title=\"Collapser source\" > <dl class=\"collapser-list\"> <dt id=\"collapser-1\">Collapser 1</dt> <dd> <p>This is the first example collapser.</p> </dd> <dt id=\"collapser-2\">Collapser 2</dt> <dd> <p>This is the second example collapser.</p> </dd> </dl> </Collapser> </CollapserGroup> Copy Collapsers triggers To open or close a collapser: Click the open buttons or Show/Hide All. Arrive at an individual collapser via an anchor ID. For example, go directly to Collapser 1 in the example above. Type the shortcut key s to show (open) all collapsers on the page. Use CMD+F (or CTRL+F) to find in page and all the collapsers will open automatically.",

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages.

      "body": "You can use this dictionary to guide your writing on docs.newrelic.com. We use this to help ensure consistency across our Docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the Docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta When using as a watermark or in the doc's title, use all caps: <div id=\"watermark\">BETA</div> Copy Don't include a callout within the document unless the beta requires additional explanation. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: <Callout variant=\"important\"> This feature currently is in private beta. To join the beta, contact your New Relic account rep. </Callout> Copy If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right-click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also mouse over. collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation Avoid referring to the document itself (the docs site page) as much as possible. If there's not a good alternative, you can use doc, document, or documentation (whatever sounds most natural; try reading it aloud). For example, This document explains how to... or For related docs, see... dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account The primary account in a New Relic account with sub-accounts. Refer to a master's subordinate accounts as sub-accounts, not children or slaves. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for watermarking docs for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account Don't use. See master account. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of Browser docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for Browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing (in Browser docs) or New Relic Browser (in non-Browser docs). Within Browser docs, use this term only for SEO or clarification, never to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures. However, avoid using generic “you” or “your” when permissions are involved, because we can't assume what permissions the user has. For example, we can't just say “you can add and remove users from your account settings” when that is actually an Owner or Admin level capability. When permissions are relevant, use a permissions callout.",

Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

If you need to change a title or a redirect, create a GitHub issue or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel. URL format A document's URL is based on its filename and filepath in the GitHub repository. For example, this is the filename and path for Rename or redirect a document: /docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document.mdx Copy The URL is: https://docs.newrelic.com/style-guide/processes-procedures/rename-or-redirect-document Copy If you rename a document's filename or change its path by moving it to a new directory, make sure to add a redirect to its old filepath. To change the document's location in the left navigation, update the navigation configuration file. Change titles To change a document title, change the title being used in the title field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc. If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the yml file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use /src/nav/style-guide.yml. Change anchor links Wherever possible, do not change the [#anchor_ids] of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the Docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the Docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta When using as a watermark or in the doc's title, use all caps: <div id=\"watermark\">BETA</div> Copy Don't include a callout within the document unless the beta requires additional explanation. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: <Callout variant=\"important\"> This feature currently is in private beta. To join the beta, contact your New Relic account rep. </Callout> Copy If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right-click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also mouse over. collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation Avoid referring to the document itself (the docs site page) as much as possible. If there's not a good alternative, you can use doc, document, or documentation (whatever sounds most natural; try reading it aloud). For example, This document explains how to... or For related docs, see... dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account The primary account in a New Relic account with sub-accounts. Refer to a master's subordinate accounts as sub-accounts, not children or slaves. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for watermarking docs for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account Don't use. See master account. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of Browser docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for Browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing (in Browser docs) or New Relic Browser (in non-Browser docs). Within Browser docs, use this term only for SEO or clarification, never to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures. However, avoid using generic “you” or “your” when permissions are involved, because we can't assume what permissions the user has. For example, we can't just say “you can add and remove users from your account settings” when that is actually an Owner or Admin level capability. When permissions are relevant, use a permissions callout.",

Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages.

      "body": "Explaining where to find UI pages and elements can be tricky. When done well, path descriptions can make navigating our UI easier for readers. Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the UI vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the UI for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title. Set up your local environment Install GitHub Desktop, and then navigate to GitHub Desktop's preferences. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Once GitHub Desktop is set up, navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you are merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) Once you are satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the conversation Conversation, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. At the bottom the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR does not break the build process of the site. Ensure all these checks pass before proceeding. The checks should finish within twenty minutes. If the Pull Request is urgent, you can skip the AWS Amplify Console Web Preview check. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Amplify: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, although it takes a long time (from 30 minutes tp up to 1.5 hours!) to build on a PR. It's easily shareable with SMEs and others. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it.",

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of our organization. If you're not sure, treat someone as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If the issue/PR is labeled eng, go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. For other issues and PRs, add the correct labels. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress, and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly—you have to move it out of draft first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero or Sidekick, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the Hero/Sidekick at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jiras, but reference Jiras by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a Browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge from develop into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM, noon, and 3 PM Pacific. Slackbot will remind us about this in #docs_deploys. The hero (or delegate) is the one who should create a PR for this and merge it. Github labels Every issue needs these labels: Always add content Add one of the pg_* labels (see this internal doc ) Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Every pull request needs these labels: Always add content Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Check the edit history of a doc or file There are two options two check the history of a file: Option 1: githistory.xy Go to a specific file in GitHub itself. Example: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz. Example: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx It will take you to a site with the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 2: Git blame Follow Github's documentation.",

It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If the issue/PR is labeled eng, go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. For other issues and PRs, add the correct labels. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress, and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly—you have to move it out of draft first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero or Sidekick, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the Hero/Sidekick at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jiras, but reference Jiras by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a Browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge from develop into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM, noon, and 3 PM Pacific. Slackbot will remind us about this in #docs_deploys. The hero (or delegate) is the one who should create a PR for this and merge it. Github labels Every issue needs these labels: Always add content Add one of the pg_* labels (see this internal doc ) Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Every pull request needs these labels: Always add content Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Check the edit history of a doc or file There are two options two check the history of a file: Option 1: githistory.xy Go to a specific file in GitHub itself. Example: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz. Example: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx It will take you to a site with the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 2: Git blame Follow Github's documentation.",

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the UI vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the UI for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title. Set up your local environment Install GitHub Desktop, and then navigate to GitHub Desktop's preferences. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Once GitHub Desktop is set up, navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you are merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) Once you are satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the conversation Conversation, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. At the bottom the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR does not break the build process of the site. Ensure all these checks pass before proceeding. The checks should finish within twenty minutes. If the Pull Request is urgent, you can skip the AWS Amplify Console Web Preview check. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Amplify: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, although it takes a long time (from 30 minutes tp up to 1.5 hours!) to build on a PR. It's easily shareable with SMEs and others. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it.",

To troubleshoot GitHub issues, see our guide. Peer editing workflow in GitHub If you’re peer editing a doc or have been otherwise assigned to a PR as a reviewer, you have a few choices for how and where to do the work. The most streamlined and open-source approach is to do the edit using GitHub options, rather than copying the file to Google Docs and editing there. Developmental edit pass For cases where you have questions and suggestions rather than straight copy edits, follow these steps. Open the PR that you’re assigned to review. On the Files changed tab, you can either: Click Review changes and then select one of the following: Comment - use if you have a comment that doesn’t require follow up. Approve - use if you just want to approve the PR. You can request changes in the Leave a comment area, and select Approve if you want to let the writer make the edits and merge the file without a follow-up review from you. Request changes - use for times when you want to make sure the changes you request are included. You’ll be notified with any updates that the writer makes. OR, start making comments on lines or sections of the doc. To do this, click the add comment icon , and leave an edit or comment for that specific line in the page. With this option, you get the choice between adding a single comment or starting a review. If you’re going to make comments throughout a doc, choose Start a review so the comments will all be rolled into one commit. Click Finish your review to complete your review. This triggers a notification to the writer alerting them that you’ve made suggestions. Copy edit workflow If you have copy edits for a file rather than comments and suggestions, you can make the changes to the file in different ways. Here are two main options: Edit using the GitHub browser: On the Files changed tab, in the diff window click the editing button (three dots). When you finish your edits, add a comment at the bottom of the file and choose to either commit the changes directly, or create a branch and start a pull request. Choose to branch and start a pull request if you expect a writer to review the diff and accept or revise your edits. Edit locally: Check out the branch containing the file you want to edit. In GitHub Desktop, click the Current branch down arrow and select the branch. Then, make the edits on your local drive, save, and commit your changes to the branch. Note that this approach adds your edits to the open pull request. You can now see the changes you added to the file on the Files changed tab in the PR. These are just a few of many editing options. You’ll find your preferred way, just as with any other tool.",

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of our organization. If you're not sure, treat someone as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If the issue/PR is labeled eng, go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. For other issues and PRs, add the correct labels. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress, and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly—you have to move it out of draft first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero or Sidekick, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the Hero/Sidekick at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jiras, but reference Jiras by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a Browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge from develop into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM, noon, and 3 PM Pacific. Slackbot will remind us about this in #docs_deploys. The hero (or delegate) is the one who should create a PR for this and merge it. Github labels Every issue needs these labels: Always add content Add one of the pg_* labels (see this internal doc ) Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Every pull request needs these labels: Always add content Add one of: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer. Optional: Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Check the edit history of a doc or file There are two options two check the history of a file: Option 1: githistory.xy Go to a specific file in GitHub itself. Example: https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx In the url, replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz. Example: https://github.githistory.xyz/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/content/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-page-action.mdx It will take you to a site with the visual history of that specific file. You can view changes by clicking through the commit history at the top of your page. Option 2: Git blame Follow Github's documentation.",

Read on for more information about our page types. Docs meta content (frontmatter) Thr top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). The title is also shown in the sidebar. Try to keep your titles as short as possible. The title will automatically be converted to a file name, lower case, punctuation removed, with dashes between words. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Start each topic with a _* on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version. watermark We use watermarks for things like beta content or to show that something is an internal New Relic doc. Commonly used watermarks are: BETA, Legacy, Deprecated, NR ONLY, etc. Watermarks look like large, faded text behind the doc's content. Document body The document body is where you edit the page content. Use the GitHub Markdown format when you write content. Page templates For most situations, use the basicDoc page template. Read on for information about our other page templates. Content type Description Basic page A standard HTML webpage without special fields. This content type is used for the majority of content on the site. API doc This format is for API reference documentation. For more information, see apiStyleGuidelines (for style guidelines) and Work with the API doc content type (for how to use and configure). Attribute definition This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see Work with attribute definition content type. Landing pages This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see Working with landing pages.

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in New Relic APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to instrument parts of your app that are not instrumented automatically. This document describes how to instrument your app by decorating the methods in your app code with attributes. Use the Transaction attribute to create a custom transaction. You can also mark the custom transaction as a web transaction with the attribute's Web property. Use the Trace attribute to add custom instrumentation to methods that are invoked within a preexisting transaction. Requirements and recommendations Requirements include: .NET agent version 6.16.178.0 or higher. You must be willing to modify your source code. If you cannot or do not want to modify your source code, use custom instrumentation via XML. Your project must have a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll (for example, installing the package and placing using NewRelic.Api.Agent; in your code). This package is in the NuGet gallery. The Transaction and Trace attributes must be applied to concrete implementations of methods. They cannot be applied on interfaces or super class method definitions. Transactions called within transactions Methods decorated with the [Transaction] attribute will only create a new transaction when one does not already exist. When a method decorated with [Transaction] is called from within a previously started transaction, it will be treated as the [Trace] attribute instead, and will provide more information about the existing transaction. Example: Calling Transaction in an already-started transaction During the execution of this console application, OuterMethod will be called first and create a new transaction. The InnerMethod is called from within the transaction started by OuterMethod, so it will not create a new transaction. Instead, information about the execution of InnerMethod will be tracked as if the [Trace] attribute had been applied. static void Main(string[] args) { OuterMethod(); } [Transaction] public void OuterMethod() { InnerMethod(); } [Transaction] public void InnerMethod() { } Copy Create a new non-web transaction To start a non-web transaction (also known as a background request) with the Transaction attribute: [Transaction] public void Run() { // your background task } Copy For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Create a new web transaction To tell the agent to mark a non-web task as a web browser transaction, use either of these options: Set the Web property of the Transaction attribute to true. Set the transaction's URI with SetTransactionUri(). [Transaction(Web = true)] public void Run() { var uri = new Uri(\"http://www.mydomain.com/path\"); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.SetTransactionUri(uri); // your web task } Copy When used inside a previously started transaction, this will be treated as a [Trace] attribute. For details about why to use either web or non-web, see Classify as web or non-web. Add detail to existing transactions with Trace If your transaction traces show large blocks of un-instrumented time and you want to include additional methods within the trace, you can use the Trace attribute: [Trace] protected void MethodWithinTransaction() { // your app code } Copy Properties for [ Transaction] The Transaction attribute supports the following properties: Web Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent starts a web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. If a transaction is in progress, then that transaction will continue. If false (default), the agent starts a non-web transaction when it reaches this Transaction attribute. For example: [Transaction(Web = true)] Copy Read forum posts about instrumentation For more specific recommendations, check out these posts in our Explorers Hub community: Troubleshoot attribute-based custom instrumentation issues Build custom instrumentation tracer factories from .NET agent log files Use other API functions For more about the .NET agent API and its functionality, see New Relic's .NET agent API guide.

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do.

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's guid, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Add a new page. Pages allow you to better organize your dashboards. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Issues with content When adding charts you may come across these issues: Error message Description Something went wrong while executing your query.

NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line 1 position 15, unexpected 'FROM' FACET and TIMESERIES are not supported on events. Your query has syntax issues. Review it in the query builder to find the error. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. Replace user data with one of the following snippets: For CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux 1 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/6/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/7/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches. Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details. dSYM files When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code. A dSYM file is an Xcode project file for debug symbols. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication. New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files. For more information, see Retrieve and download dSYMs or Upload dSYM files. Debug the crash reporter Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled: If the debugger is enabled: There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes.

Whenever possible, send the Docs team a permalink rather than an image. Important To ensure the consistency and security of any data presented in Docs site images, only the Docs team is authorized to add or update screenshots and other images on the Docs site. The goal of this document it to give you some tips about creating images, but if you need help embedding them on our site, see Embed images. Guidelines for image types Review the Tech Docs team's five questions to decide how to write excellent docs and to convey information visually. Depending on the type of image, follow these guidelines. Icons Use the Font Awesome library to embed generic icons. Inline images Use inline images for buttons, icons, or other graphic elements in New Relic's user interface that Font Awesome icons cannot effectively represent. Graphical illustrations Use graphical illustrations such as flow charts and diagrams to visualize complex ideas and as an alternative to screenshots. Best practices for graphical illustrations Comments Choose the right level of abstraction. Make sure the flow chart or diagram clearly explains what you want to communicate but also is easy to scan. Label every item. Make sure that readers understand what each object represents. Label every connector (lines, arrows, etc.) Make sure that readers understand the relationship between connected objects. Define every use of color or shape. Make sure you use colors and shapes consistently. If two different colors do not mean two different things, then use the same color. Use nested objects to indicate independent purposes. If you need to nest objects within a larger object, make sure each object has a distinct meanings. Include a caption. Make sure your caption summarizes what the overall flow chart or diagram intends to communicate (see our caption tips below). Use sentence case. Make sure all labels are written in sentence case. Only capitalize the first letter of a first word, proper noun, acronym, or abbreviation. Screenshots When the Docs team can't access the product or feature and the other alternatives aren't sufficient, keep in mind New Relic Security guidelines to capture screenshots or other images, and avoid private information from New Relic or from customers. In addition: Always crop or mask sensitive information. Avoid annotating them with text boxes, arrows, circles, etc. Save the width at approximately 1200 to 1400 pixels. Consider adding a caption (see our tips below). Guidelines for explaining images Supporting text can provide helpful context and explanation, especially for complicated screenshots and other images that may be tricky to understand on their own. While you should always include alt text for accessibility, the other types of supporting text are optional. Read on for guidelines and suggestions for when to use them. Alt text (required) Caption Surrounding text Annotations within the image Alt text (Required) Always include alt text in your image tags so visually impaired readers can use their screen readers to get useful information out of the images. This only applies to images that contain content or commands (for example, buttons). Tip Alt text doesn't apply to inline Font Awesome icons. When using alt text: Use concise image descriptions. Don't repeat surrounding text—screen readers already read that. Aim for clarity. Complete sentences aren't required. Identify the type of image in some way: <img alt=\"Diagram showing the flow of data from client to server.\"> <img alt=\"Screen capture showing how to select a server.\"> <img alt=\"Photo of garden hose that serves as a metaphor for electrical amperage.\"> Alt-text If you are using Chrome, you can view this alt-text example by right-clicking on the image and selecting Inspect. Caption Captions appear below images and give supporting context to readers. Keep the following in mind: Keep captions short and don’t insert procedures. Only insert navigation paths in captions if navigation is a key part of the message. Insert complementary information not identical to surrounding text. Make captions that are easy to skim. Encourage readers to look at surrounding text. Don't put required information in captions that isn't available elsewhere. Captions aren't necessary in procedure screenshots because the procedure text should make things clear. Use \"Figure X\" to refer to images elsewhere. Include a link to the image. Preceding text and a caption Here’s an example that has preceding text and a caption: Surrounding text If you're not using captions or annotations, be sure to add text before or after the image to give helpful context. If you're relying on surrounding text to explain your image: Use intuitive images. Keep the surrounding text concise so it's easier to make sense of the image. Text preceding and following an image Here's are images that don't need captions because the surrounding text explains them: Image annotations Image annotations are text and shapes in screen captures or diagrams that help to explain the image. If an image has annotations that explain what readers need to know, captions may be redundant. When using annotations: Be concise. Make sure annotations are easy to distinguish from UI text. For example, you may need to offset your boxes so they don't look like UI elements. Annotations aren't translated, so use them sparingly. Use our New Relic SnagIt theme (link only available to New Relic employees) to keep your annotations consistent. To import the New Relic theme: Open SnagIt. In the Quick Styles pane, select the Theme gear icon. Select Import. Annotations as titles Here’s an example of an image that has an annotation at the top that acts like a title:",

      "body": "If you have services that run on Docker containers in Amazon ECS (like Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services), you can use New Relic to report data from those services, from the host, and from the containers. Requirements To monitor services running on ECS, you must meet these requirements: An auto-scaling ECS cluster running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL that meets the infrastructure agent compatibility and requirements. ECS tasks must have network mode set to none or bridge (awsvpc and host not supported). A supported service running on ECS that meets our integration requirements: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP How to enable Before explaining how to enable monitoring of services running in ECS, here's an overview of the process: Enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on your ECS clusters. Enable monitoring of services using a service-specific configuration file. Step 1: Enable EC2 to install the infrastructure agent First, you must enable Amazon EC2 to install our infrastructure agent on ECS clusters. To do this, you'll first need to update your user data to install the infrastructure agent on launch. Here are instructions for changing EC2 launch configuration (taken from Amazon EC2 documentation): Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. Replace user data with one of the following snippets: For CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux 1 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/6/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2 Replace the highlighted fields with relevant values: Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"MIMEBOUNDARY\" MIME-Version: 1.0 --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"init.cfg\" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/cloud-config Mime-Version: 1.0 yum_repos: newrelic-infra: baseurl: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/linux/yum/el/7/x86_64 gpgkey: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/gpg/newrelic-infra.gpg gpgcheck: 1 repo_gpgcheck: 1 enabled: true name: New Relic Infrastructure write_files: - content: | --- # New Relic config file license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY path: /etc/newrelic-infra.yml packages: - newrelic-infra - nri-* runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] --MIMEBOUNDARY Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Content-Type: text/x-shellscript Mime-Version: 1.0 #!/bin/bash # ECS config { echo \"ECS_CLUSTER=YOUR_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME\" } >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config start ecs echo \"Done\" --MIMEBOUNDARY-- Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop-down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. To test if the agent is automatically detecting instances, terminate an EC2 instance in the auto scaling group: the replacement instance will now be launched with the new user data. After five minutes, you should see data from the new host on the Hosts page. Next, move on to enabling the monitoring of services. Step 2: Enable monitoring of services Once you've enabled EC2 to run the infrastructure agent, the agent starts monitoring the containers running on that host. Next, we'll explain how to monitor services deployed on ECS. For example, you can monitor an ECS task containing an NGINX instance that sits in front of your application server. Here's a brief overview of how you'd monitor a supported service deployed on ECS: Create a YAML configuration file for the service you want to monitor. This will eventually be placed in the EC2 user data section via the AWS console. But before doing that, you can test that the config is working by placing that file in the infrastructure agent folder (etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d) in EC2. That config file must use our container auto-discovery format, which allows it to automatically find containers. The exact config options will depend on the specific integration. Check to see that data from the service is being reported to New Relic. If you are satisfied with the data you see, you can then use the EC2 console to add that configuration to the appropriate launch configuration, in the write_files section, and then update the auto scaling group. In the runcmd section, add the yum command to install the integration to the appropriate launch configuration. Here's a detailed example of doing the above procedure for NGINX: Ensure you have SSH access to the server or access to AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Log in to the host running the infrastructure agent. Via the command line, change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Create a file called nginx-config.yml and add the following snippet: --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration causes the infrastructure agent to look for containers in ECS that contain nginx. Once a container matches, it then connects to the NGINX status page. For details on how the discovery.ip snippet works, see auto-discovery. For details on general NGINX configuration, see the NGINX integration. If your NGINX status page is set to serve requests from the STATUS_URL on port 80, the infrastructure agent starts monitoring it. After five minutes, verify that NGINX data is appearing in the Infrastructure UI (either: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third party services, or one.newrelic.com > Explorer > On-host). If the configuration works, place it in the EC2 launch configuration: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Launch configurations. On the next page, select the launch configuration you want to update. Right click and select Copy launch configuration. On the Launch configuration details tab, click Edit details. In the User data section, edit the write_files section (in the part marked text/cloud-config). Add a new file/content entry: - content: | --- discovery: docker: match: image: /nginx/ integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}:/status REMOTE_MONITORING: true METRICS: 1 path: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nginx-config.yml Copy Also edit the runcmd section to include the yum command to install nri-nginx: runcmd: - [ yum, install, newrelic-infra, -y ] - [ yum, install, nri-nginx, -y ] - [ systemctl, daemon-reload ] - [ systemctl, enable, newrelic-infra.service ] - [ systemctl, start, --no-block, newrelic-infra.service ] Copy Choose Skip to review. Choose Create launch configuration. Next, update the auto scaling group: Open the Amazon EC2 console. On the navigation pane, under Auto scaling, choose Auto scaling groups. Select the auto scaling group you want to update. From the Actions menu, choose Edit. In the drop down menu for Launch configuration, select the new launch configuration created. Click Save. When an EC2 instance is terminated, it is replaced with a new one that automatically looks for new NGINX containers.",

Once you integrate, your data will be visible in query-based dashboards (and other query results), often within about five minutes. Why it matters Unlike Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, which scrape data from Prometheus endpoints, the remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. You can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries and dashboards and beyond. With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional) Compatibility New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Scale your data and get moving quickly Once logged in to New Relic, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. View your data. What's next Ready to get started? Read the setup documentation.

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the UI vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the UI for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title. Set up your local environment Install GitHub Desktop, and then navigate to GitHub Desktop's preferences. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Once GitHub Desktop is set up, navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you are merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) Once you are satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the conversation Conversation, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. At the bottom the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR does not break the build process of the site. Ensure all these checks pass before proceeding. The checks should finish within twenty minutes. If the Pull Request is urgent, you can skip the AWS Amplify Console Web Preview check. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Amplify: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, although it takes a long time (from 30 minutes tp up to 1.5 hours!) to build on a PR. It's easily shareable with SMEs and others. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it.",

      "body": "This document serves as a supplement to the basic <var> and <mark> documentation. It gives a longer explanation of when to use the <var> and <mark> formatting styles, and reasons for not using them. var: Highlight user-specific values in procedural code snippets The <var> tag is used for user-input values in code snippets that customers would be using in procedural/functional ways. For example, you would use the <var> tag when explaining how to do some specific task. A <var> tag would not be used for: Example code: If the code is meant to be an example, to show the format/structure of the code, and there is not an actual procedure the customer is following, var tags are not needed. Examples: Example configuration file (or this Java agent config template): if you are showing an example config file that isn't part of a procedure, you shouldn't use the <var> tag. Several reasons for this: 1) The important part of showing an example config file is to show the overall structure of the file, 2) Usually the number of config options present in a file will vary based on whatever the customer wishes to use, so using <var> tags can actually be confusing as it implies that these values must be present. Instrumentation procedure (at bottom of the Java section): the var tag wouldn't be necessary because it's an example, not part of a procedure, and the main goal is seeing the general structure. Also, because it's an example of app code, the concept of user-specific values doesn't have much meaning, because the entire code will vary dependent on how the customer has written their code. (If anything, this would be a potential for using <mark> format to emphasize the New Relic functions.) Response/output code: If the code is meant to show an expected return, and is not related to a procedure, then var tags shouldn't be used. Here's a doc section (the returned JSON) where var tags are not needed. For an example of a doc section with both <var> formatting and without it, see the Synthetics monitors REST API example. The first block shows a command they might choose to run, hence it uses a <var> tag. The second block is just an example output, showing the structure that would be returned; it doesn't require a <var> tag. For some use cases, highlighting may be a better choice than a var tag. var format examples Below are some general style recommendations for formatting user-specific <var> values. <var> tag formatting may vary based on language- or system-specific expectations, so be sure check the style used in the documentation section in question, and to ask relevant SMEs what they think of the style. Account IDs and other IDs/#s: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_API_CODE, etc. This should be the general style used. URLs: example.com, or maybe YOUR_URL Paths: PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe or maybe PATH_TO_FILE Emails: datanerd@example.com or maybe YOUR_EMAIL Bash variables for REST API code: Some <var> tagged code values on the docs site have the form $ { API_KEY}. This is a format used for variables in bash scripts, where users assign values to specific variable names and then call those variables later in the script by using the $VARIABLE_NAME. For more info, see this explanation of bash variables. Important The bash variable style is currently used in the REST API docs and in some Synthetics docs and that's fine. But going forward we should use the general variable style (without the $ and &lt; >). mark: Emphasize non-procedure code snippets Highlighting (<mark>) is used for when you want to draw attention to a variable or value, but it's not something directly procedural related. Here are two examples of highlighting: Highlighting values in code response that are meant for later use: Activate Azure integrations doc. Highlighting the commands in a large code block example that are New Relic-specific commands, with explanations below: Java API doc.",

      "body": "Are you having problems working on a doc in GitHub? Check out the following common issues. GitHub authentication fails If you suddenly find that you can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop, you may have developed a problem with SSH. If logging out of GitHub Desktop via Preferences doesn’t seem to help, you can confirm if you have an SSH issue by switching to the command line and trying to push manually. For example: git push --set-upstream origin second-kafka-pr-for-issue-1123 If this command prompts you for a passphrase, your SSH was somehow confused. By entering your passphrase, you should be back in business. If you can’t remember your passphrase, check out this article. My build is failing mysteriously Here’s a few things you can check if your build is failing: Indenting in the nav files Front matter If there's apostrophes and colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems. Missing closed brackets or tags Poorly formatted image links Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail. Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported. Image filenames Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc. Images with encoded values (like %) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them. Issues with the local site If you're running with issues with your local build, try these options: Stop and restart yarn In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary. Run yarn && yarn start. Ensure the problem isn't with your branch In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the Develop branch. 4 Back in the terminal, run yarn && yarn start. If the site now builds correctly, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot. Clean your local cache Run yarn clean to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time! In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Begin a new build by running yarn clean && yarn && yarn start. Remove corrupted cache files There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on. To solve this, run rm -rf .cache. Start a build from start Blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache and start a build from scratch. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary. Blow away modules and cache and start from scratch running rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf .cache && yarn && yarn clean. When everything completes, start the site yarn start. You may need to add sudo at the start of the rm commands. Run your local build in private mode Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. Running the local build in a private/incognito session may to fix this issue. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache. My redirect throws a 404 error when testing it locally Redirects are a bit strange on local builds. To test them, navigate to the page that is being redirected, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, ensure you set up the redirect correctly. A check fails in the PR Rarely, a build or check will fail due to some internal error. You can re-run the check by going to the PR, clicking Details, and then clicking Re-run jobs. If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot. Reset the Gatsby build check Caution This adds a LOT of time to the build check. There are times the Gatsby Build check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache. In your local repo, find the file gatsby-config.js (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode). Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache. const fs = require('fs'); const parse = require('rehype-parse'); Save the file and commit the change to your PR. Re-run the build checks. Wait a LOOOOONG time. Troubleshoot merging conflicts Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. Here are some tips on how to get through it. Fix your merge conflict as soon as possible. Especially if you’re working on taxonomy changes. If your branch lingers for a while it can get outdated from develop pretty fast and that can cause some unexpected issues. Check your fix locally to make sure that it looks good there. Ask your PR approver to review your PR after you fix the merge conflict. Here are two options to resolve conflicts: When you see the conflicts in GitHub desktop, click the option to resolve these in VS Code. Use the GitHub website editor (click the Resolve conflict button) to fix these. What’s new related merge conflicts Merge conflicts pop up pretty often with what’s new posts because the whats-new-ids.json file that’s automatically updated when the site builds can get out-of-date pretty fast. If you see changes to this file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them, rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file.",

Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products).

      "body": "Our five questions form the core of how our Tech Docs team thinks about writing excellent technical documentation. Informally, we call these our 5Qs. Anyone can contribute to our Docs site. We want you to feel confident and proud that your contributions provide valuable content and quality. We also want our readers to trust and easily use the information in our docs. To help you plan, write, and edit excellent docs, ask yourself the questions in this doc. There's really only 1Q The 5Qs exist to help answer one question. Whenever you write a doc, ask yourself: What problem are we trying to solve? It's critical you know what you're trying to do and why that goal matters to your readers. Asking the five questions (and the sub-questions!) will help you ensure you're building the right thing. 5Qs and sub-questions Each of the five questions includes sub-questions to help guide your thinking. 1. Did you use or observe the thing you are writing about? Think about who your audience is and the level of complexity they need. End users' point of view Ask yourself: Audience Do you know who is reading your document (dev/ops teams, support personnel, non-technical staff, etc.)? Can you articulate what this thing is (feature, procedure) and why it matters to our customers? For conceptual info, did you interview multiple stakeholders? Testing Put yourself in the user's shoes. For example: Did you use the thing on your own? Did you watch a subject matter expert use the thing? If you can't do it on your own or observe, did you send the draft to at least three SMEs? Before publishing Did you compare the final version of your text against the thing you're writing about? 2. Is this the best place to put this information? Think about where this information belongs. Where does this information belong? Ask yourself: What problem are you trying to solve? Is text always the best answer? Does this doc need to exist at all? For example: Are we duplicating content from somewhere else in the Docs site? Are we duplicating content already in the UI? Could customers have a better experience if we modified the UI design or copy instead of creating a doc? Would another web property be a better home for this information? For example: The Explorers Hub? NRU course? NRU video embedded into the doc? The public New Relic blog? The public New Relic website? 3. Can readers tell in ten seconds if they are in the right place? Think about what the content is and what you can do to make the information easy to skim to find information. Can users skim to find information? Ask yourself: Title and headings Does the title accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the headings accurately represent what's in the doc? Do the title and headings use words the way your readers do? Do the title and headings avoid New Relic jargon? Structure Does the overall structure of the doc help readers find what they're looking for? Is the doc trying to address too many topics? When you glance at the doc, do you see short paragraphs, short sentences, and other visual aids? Or do you see a dense wall of text? Introduction Does the intro give a concise synopsis of what's in the doc? Does the intro give readers an alternate path if they're in the wrong place? 4. Is the information in the best possible format? Think about how to present the information visually. Presentation of information Ask yourself: Visual formats Did you use visual formats appropriately? Would a screenshot make any of the information easier to understand? Does your image caption clearly explain what matters so that the user does not necessarily even need to read the surrounding text? Would a diagram make any of the information easier to understand? Is there a video we could embed to make things clearer? Can step-by-step UI procedures be replaced with a \"show me\" video? Procedures Are your procedures well-structured? Do step-by-step UI procedures even need to be documented? Did you limit the procedural text to action steps and omit detailed explanatory text or edge cases? If detailed explanations need to enhance a procedure, have you organized the info in a way that expert users can skip the details? Text flow Read your draft more than once. Is the documentation direct and to the point? Did you use bullets, tables, or clamshells to improve flow? 5. Is the language approachable, expert, and visionary? Think about why the information matters and why readers will trust and use it. For tips to make it easier for users to read, understand, and use documentation, go to plainlanguage.gov. Also, if you are a New Relic employee, we encourage you to review the corporate brand guidelines. For more information, contact Marketing. Effective language Ask yourself: Readers' point of view Did you tell users why as well as how? Can you articulate not only what this thing is (feature, procedure) and also why it matters to our customers? Did you include useful examples or use cases? Did you include information about relationships this feature has to other New Relic platform tools? Style guide resources Did you follow our style guide? Did you use our edit checklist? Did you use pronouns, contractions, and a conversational tone throughout? Did you review the usage dictionary and other resources in the style guide to make sure that terms are used correctly? Readability Is the text easy to read? Is the language clear? Do you have to reread any sentences or paragraphs to understand them? If so, can you simplify the wording and sentence structure? Does the doc score 40 or better on the Flesch-Kinkaid reading ease scale? If not, try taking another pass at the prose. But don't chase the Flesch-Kincaid score in itself: we're not out to frustrate ourselves, but to write docs that are a pleasure to read. Where to go from here Did you offer readers a clear \"next step\" in each section? If it is necessary to tell a user not to do something, did you also tell them what to do instead? Is the topic complete? Is the doc actionable?",

      "body": "Browser uses a JavaScript snippet (or \"agent\") to instrument your app's webpages. The JavaScript collects data for browser monitoring. To install the browser agent, you can choose from a number of deployment options. Tip To use Browser and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic Browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot Browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see Query your data and Introduction to NRQL.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Full Stack Observability We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > Transactions > Transaction traces > (select a trace) > Another thing.

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "At times, for a variety of reasons, an incoming signal can be lost and it’s important to know if this is a delay or if it’s the beginning of a much larger problem. New Relic One now provides official support for loss of signal detection on any NRQL Alert Condition. To see if it’s simply a delay in signal or something worse, you can now configure loss of signal detection by specifying how many seconds the system should wait, from the time the last data point was detected, before considering the signal to be lost. If the signal does not return before your specified time expires, you can choose to be notified that the signal has been lost, or you can simply choose to close any related open violations if you expected the entity or signal to disappear. We know that not all signals or time series that are being monitored have a consistent flow of data points. Because New Relic evaluates incoming data in specific windows of time, in many cases, the telemetry signals you send to New Relic can have gaps, meaning that some time windows will not have data. You now have the option to implement multiple strategies for how those gaps should be filled–sometimes called extrapolation strategies–including setting a static value, using the previously detected value, or not doing anything. When editing a NRQL Alert Condition, you can configure loss of signal detection under Condition settings > Set your condition thresholds and gap filling under Condition settings > Fine-tune advanced signal settings.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Tip To use synthetic monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature.

With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (New Relic Browser) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 20. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted Browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic. See APIs in action For more on how you as a developer can optimize your ability to solve problems using New Relic, go to developer.newrelic.com.",

Feature description When you take specific actions in synthetic monitoring like creating or editing a monitor, an NrAuditEvent is generated. This event includes details about the action taken and which user took that action. This data is stored for 13 months. This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details. Query details To query changes, use the query builder to explore the NrAuditEvent and its associated attributes. For an introduction to using the NrAuditEvent event, see Query account audit logs. Supported actionIdentifier events currently include: Monitors synthetics_monitor.create synthetics_monitor.update synthetics_monitor.create_script synthetics_monitor.update_script synthetics_monitor.validate_script synthetics_monitor.delete Monitor downtimes synthetics_monitor_downtime.create synthetics_monitor_downtime.update synthetics_monitor_downtime.delete Secure credentials synthetics_secure_credential.create synthetics_secure_credential.update synthetics_secure_credential.view synthetics_secure_credential.delete Private locations synthetics_private_location.create​ synthetics_private_location.update​ synthetics_private_location.delete How the change was made: The actorAPIKey attribute indicates if the change was made via the API or by a user via the UI.

The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted. One by one, you and the employee review the list and update the edited monitors.",

Feature description When you take specific actions in synthetic monitoring like creating or editing a monitor, an NrAuditEvent is generated. This event includes details about the action taken and which user took that action. This data is stored for 13 months. This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details. Query details To query changes, use the query builder to explore the NrAuditEvent and its associated attributes. For an introduction to using the NrAuditEvent event, see Query account audit logs. Supported actionIdentifier events currently include: Monitors synthetics_monitor.create synthetics_monitor.update synthetics_monitor.create_script synthetics_monitor.update_script synthetics_monitor.validate_script synthetics_monitor.delete Monitor downtimes synthetics_monitor_downtime.create synthetics_monitor_downtime.update synthetics_monitor_downtime.delete Secure credentials synthetics_secure_credential.create synthetics_secure_credential.update synthetics_secure_credential.view synthetics_secure_credential.delete Private locations synthetics_private_location.create​ synthetics_private_location.update​ synthetics_private_location.delete How the change was made: The actorAPIKey attribute indicates if the change was made via the API or by a user via the UI.

The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted. One by one, you and the employee review the list and update the edited monitors.",

Daily JSON listings for IP addresses IP addresses for released locations are subject to change. If a change is needed, New Relic will attempt to proactively notify customers prior to any changes via e-mail. You can also check the Explorers Hub for updates. Important Synthetics is adding new IP addresses on July 15 2021. Tip In the S3 URL paths for this feature, production represents US-based accounts and eu represents EU-based accounts.

This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details. Query details To query changes, use the query builder to explore the NrAuditEvent and its associated attributes. For an introduction to using the NrAuditEvent event, see Query account audit logs.

The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted. One by one, you and the employee review the list and update the edited monitors.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Tip To use synthetic monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. By design, it captures what is essentially performance data for simulated traffic. Tt does not capture or handle any personal data by default. All data handled by synthetic monitors is expected to be non-personal. This document provides additional details about what we do to ensure data privacy and security with synthetic monitoring, plus additional options you can use. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. What we do Here's a summary of the data privacy and security measures that New Relic provides for you. Data privacy and security Comments No personal data By definition, all data collected through synthetic monitoring is test data created for the purpose of monitoring. None of this data includes personal data from any individual. TLS TLS encryption is required for all domains. This applies to public locations and private locations. Authentication Synthetic monitoring supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. Available options depend on the type of monitor you choose. Data collection The data transferred to the synthetic endpoint includes: Monitor run results, including full request and response headers of all requests, a complete HAR file of the session, and any screenshots captured (on failure or manually) Polling for available jobs in the private location's queue Private minion \"heartbeat\" every 30 seconds The SyntheticsPrivateMinion event contains basic minion status, including job success and failure counts, queue size, minion version, etc. Data received Data received from the synthetic monitoring endpoint contains the scheduled check's details. This includes the information necessary to complete the check for the minion: Target URL Validation text Full script (for synthetic scripted browser monitors) Data storage location Data collected by synthetic monitoring is stored in the region selected by each customer for their account (US or EU). Monitor configuration details (including frequency, check locations, target URL, and the full script for any scripted browser or API test monitors) are stored on our end. We also store all monitor check results for each monitor type. Data storage by monitor type For ping monitors, data storage includes the HAR file, which includes all requests and responses made during the check. For simple browsers, scripted browsers, and API tests, data storage includes the following: The HAR file includes full request and response headers for all requests made during the check. Any screenshots taken during the check are automatically included for simple and scripted browser monitors only on failure. However, you can manually configure this with scripting. The browser log (JS console) is automatically included for simple and scripted browsers. Any script output is included for scripted browsers and API test monitors. Response bodies New Relic never stores response bodies from requests originated by synthetic monitoring, unless you have manually configured a monitor script to do so. IP addresses Synthetic public minions are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. Their IP addresses are not defined as personal data under data protection and privacy laws. What you can do For additional levels of security and data privacy, consider using these options. Additional measures Comments User access To control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations, set up role-based synthetic monitoring permissions and user groups. In addition, to track and be notified about changes, use audit logs and alert notifications. Passwords, API keys, user names, etc. To securely store sensitive information, use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Sites behind firewalls To control what sites you want to monitor behind your firewall, you can: Add the synthetic public minion IP addresses to your allow list or deny list. Use private locations to monitor sites or endpoints. This can provide an extra layer of security when monitoring your internally hosted sites and services. Web pages behind login pages If you configure synthetic monitoring to track website areas that are located behind a login page, be sure to create a non-personal login specifically for this purpose. This unique login will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. Proxy configuration Aside from the target URLs monitored by New Relic, private minions will regularly send data to and receive from the synthetic monitoring endpoint. To configure a proxy for all traffic to and from this endpoint, set the MINION_API_PROXY environment variable on the minion host. Private minions security To ensure that only the scripts you intend to run are allowed to run on private minions, use verified script execution.",

Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Tip To use synthetic monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Tip To use synthetic monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. By design, it captures what is essentially performance data for simulated traffic. Tt does not capture or handle any personal data by default. All data handled by synthetic monitors is expected to be non-personal. This document provides additional details about what we do to ensure data privacy and security with synthetic monitoring, plus additional options you can use. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. What we do Here's a summary of the data privacy and security measures that New Relic provides for you. Data privacy and security Comments No personal data By definition, all data collected through synthetic monitoring is test data created for the purpose of monitoring. None of this data includes personal data from any individual. TLS TLS encryption is required for all domains. This applies to public locations and private locations. Authentication Synthetic monitoring supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. Available options depend on the type of monitor you choose. Data collection The data transferred to the synthetic endpoint includes: Monitor run results, including full request and response headers of all requests, a complete HAR file of the session, and any screenshots captured (on failure or manually) Polling for available jobs in the private location's queue Private minion \"heartbeat\" every 30 seconds The SyntheticsPrivateMinion event contains basic minion status, including job success and failure counts, queue size, minion version, etc. Data received Data received from the synthetic monitoring endpoint contains the scheduled check's details. This includes the information necessary to complete the check for the minion: Target URL Validation text Full script (for synthetic scripted browser monitors) Data storage location Data collected by synthetic monitoring is stored in the region selected by each customer for their account (US or EU). Monitor configuration details (including frequency, check locations, target URL, and the full script for any scripted browser or API test monitors) are stored on our end. We also store all monitor check results for each monitor type. Data storage by monitor type For ping monitors, data storage includes the HAR file, which includes all requests and responses made during the check. For simple browsers, scripted browsers, and API tests, data storage includes the following: The HAR file includes full request and response headers for all requests made during the check. Any screenshots taken during the check are automatically included for simple and scripted browser monitors only on failure. However, you can manually configure this with scripting. The browser log (JS console) is automatically included for simple and scripted browsers. Any script output is included for scripted browsers and API test monitors. Response bodies New Relic never stores response bodies from requests originated by synthetic monitoring, unless you have manually configured a monitor script to do so. IP addresses Synthetic public minions are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. Their IP addresses are not defined as personal data under data protection and privacy laws. What you can do For additional levels of security and data privacy, consider using these options. Additional measures Comments User access To control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations, set up role-based synthetic monitoring permissions and user groups. In addition, to track and be notified about changes, use audit logs and alert notifications. Passwords, API keys, user names, etc. To securely store sensitive information, use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Sites behind firewalls To control what sites you want to monitor behind your firewall, you can: Add the synthetic public minion IP addresses to your allow list or deny list. Use private locations to monitor sites or endpoints. This can provide an extra layer of security when monitoring your internally hosted sites and services. Web pages behind login pages If you configure synthetic monitoring to track website areas that are located behind a login page, be sure to create a non-personal login specifically for this purpose. This unique login will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. Proxy configuration Aside from the target URLs monitored by New Relic, private minions will regularly send data to and receive from the synthetic monitoring endpoint. To configure a proxy for all traffic to and from this endpoint, set the MINION_API_PROXY environment variable on the minion host. Private minions security To ensure that only the scripts you intend to run are allowed to run on private minions, use verified script execution.",

Change the time frame Use the time picker to adjust the number of results returned for the following charts: Request/response times Connection times Non-200 response codes This is only available for ping monitor results. Legacy charts Important The following table applies to the old view of the synthetic monitoring summary page. Click Show new view to access a new curated summary experience. Synthetic chart Description Load time chart This shows the load times for each monitor location. When you select a short time frame (such as 30 minutes), Synthetics displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (New Relic Browser) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident.

For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor.

For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime.

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "After installing your containerized private minion (CPM), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways: Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the CPM status endpoint. See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state. Check if your private location requires more minions If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks. To learn how to verify this, see Does my private location need more minions? Review logs You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs.

Copy Enable debug logs If you experience issues with your CPM, you can enable debug logs to help troubleshoot issues. The default level of logging is set to only inform the user of key information and actionable errors. If this is insufficient, you can enable a more verbose logging by using the MINION_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.

To enable DEBUG logs add the --set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG option when running your helm install: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY --set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG Copy Get the name of the CPM pod you want to review logs for: kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Then, interact with that CPM pod: kubectl logs -f -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME ... verbose logging continues ... Copy Retrieve Kubernetes debugging information If you experience issues with your CPM in a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, you can retrieve information about the CPM pod and the node it is running on to help troubleshoot. To retrieve information for the CPM pod: kubectl describe pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy To retrieve information for the node the CPM pod is running on, identify the node, and then: kubectl describe node NODE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy Monitor CPMs with New Relic Infrastructure New Relic's infrastructure monitoring supports advanced Docker monitoring and advanced Kubernetes monitoring. To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM.

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs. Docker environment configuration The variables are provided at startup using the -e, --env argument. The following table shows all the environment variables that CPM supports. MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY is required, and all other variables are optional. Name Description MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY REQUIRED. UUID of the Private Location, as found on the Private Location Web page. DOCKER_API_VERSION Format: \"vX.Y\" API version to be used with the given Docker service. Default: v1.35. DOCKER_HOST Points the minion to a given DOCKER_HOST. If absent, the default value is /var/run/docker.sock. MINION_API_ENDPOINT For US-based accounts, the endpoint is: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net. For EU-based accounts, the endpoint is: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Ensure your CPM can connect to the appropriate endpoint in order to serve your monitor. MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT The Docker Registry and Organization where the Minion Runner image is hosted. Use this to override quay.io/newrelic as the default (for example, docker.io/newrelic). MINION_API_PROXY Format: \"host:port\".

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints.

To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "After installing your containerized private minion (CPM), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways: Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the CPM status endpoint. See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state. Check if your private location requires more minions If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks. To learn how to verify this, see Does my private location need more minions? Review logs You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs.

To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep.

Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "After installing your containerized private minion (CPM), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways: Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the CPM status endpoint. See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state. Check if your private location requires more minions If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks. To learn how to verify this, see Does my private location need more minions? Review logs You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs.

To retrieve information for the CPM pod: kubectl describe pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy To retrieve information for the node the CPM pod is running on, identify the node, and then: kubectl describe node NODE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy Monitor CPMs with New Relic Infrastructure New Relic's infrastructure monitoring supports advanced Docker monitoring and advanced Kubernetes monitoring. To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "After installing your containerized private minion (CPM), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways: Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the CPM status endpoint. See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state. Check if your private location requires more minions If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks. To learn how to verify this, see Does my private location need more minions? Review logs You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs.

To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "When using synthetic monitoring's private locations with New Relic's alerts, you can be notified if a location is under-provisioned, mis-configured, or generally misbehaving. This guide will help you answer the following basic questions regarding private location health by using New Relic dashboards and NRQL alerts: Are my private minions online? Does my private location need more minions? Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? Prerequisites Before following the instructions in this guide, ensure you have: A synthetic private location At least one private minion installed at that location Checks scheduled to run at that location An alert policy for the private location, with a configured notification channel to notify your team when a violation occurs The Private Minion dashboard example can be imported to your account using the Dashboard API with the following JSON: Private Minion dashboard JSON { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"Synthetics Private Minions\", \"description\": \"Synthetics Private Minions Dashboard\", \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Location\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionLocation) as 'Location' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Minions reporting\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT uniques(minionId) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago limit 500\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.table\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Alive since\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(minionStartTimestamp) as 'Birthday' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago facet minionId limit 200\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"CPU load %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionProcessorsUsagePercentage) as 'CPU load %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Used memory %\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryUsedPercentage) as 'Used memory %' from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Free memory GB\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1, \"query\": \"SELECT max(minionPhysicalMemoryFreeBytes / 1e9) from SyntheticsPrivateMinion since 30 minutes ago timeseries 1 minute facet minionId\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "After installing your containerized private minion (CPM), you can keep track of its maintenance and monitoring in several ways: Check if the CPM is healthy and working with the CPM status endpoint. See if a private location is under-provisioned and needs more minions. Review your Docker logs or Kubernetes logs. Tip You can also get notified of monitor failures with New Relic's alerts. Check CPM status using HTTP Connecting to a running CPM using HTTP is the easiest way to check if it's healthy and working. The container exposes two ports: 8080 and 8180. You can check the CPM with the following endpoints: :8080/status/check: provides details about internal health checks that the minion performs. HTTP 200 means the status is healthy. :8080/status: provides details about a minion's status, which is the same data published in Insights as SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: provides JVM application admin endpoints. This is an advanced view of a minion's Java Development Kit (JDK) internal state. Check if your private location requires more minions If your private location has multiple monitor checks queued up and you experience delays, you may need more minions available to execute the monitor checks. To learn how to verify this, see Does my private location need more minions? Review logs You can monitor your minion's health by looking at CPM container logs. Review Docker logs This is an example of a CPM log indicating that the minion is working properly in a Docker container system environment: $docker logs [YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME] 2018-10-10 11:33:29,856 - Minion ID: a21f6d7f-4f65-4dec-92fb-88cb975d2a19 2018-10-10 11:33:29,869 - Publishing resources for Private Minion API: /status/check, /build-info, /status 2018-10-10 11:33:40,527 - Minion is configured, checking if it is healthy... 2018-10-10 11:33:43,471 - Launching in PRIVATE Location: 123456-example_private_loc-480 2018-10-10 11:33:43,723 - Configured 2 heavy worker threads, and 50 light worker threads 2018-10-10 11:33:43,796 - 2018-10-10 11:33:43,796 - ************************************************************************** 2018-10-10 11:33:43,796 - * Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location 'example_private_location' 2018-10-10 11:33:43,796 - ************************************************************************** ... logging continues ...

Copy Enable debug logs If you experience issues with your CPM, you can enable debug logs to help troubleshoot issues. The default level of logging is set to only inform the user of key information and actionable errors. If this is insufficient, you can enable a more verbose logging by using the MINION_LOG_LEVEL environment variable. Enable Docker debug logs Tip Adding -f to the Docker logs makes the command follow logs. docker run ... -e MINION_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ... docker logs -f YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ... verbose logging continues ... Copy Enable Kubernetes debug logs Tip Adding -f to the Kubernetes logs makes the command follow logs. To enable DEBUG logs add the --set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG option when running your helm install: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY --set synthetics.minionLogLevel=DEBUG Copy Get the name of the CPM pod you want to review logs for: kubectl get pods -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Then, interact with that CPM pod: kubectl logs -f -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME ... verbose logging continues ... Copy Retrieve Kubernetes debugging information If you experience issues with your CPM in a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, you can retrieve information about the CPM pod and the node it is running on to help troubleshoot. To retrieve information for the CPM pod: kubectl describe pod -n YOUR_NAMESPACE YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy To retrieve information for the node the CPM pod is running on, identify the node, and then: kubectl describe node NODE_ASSOCIATED_WITH_YOUR_CPM_POD_NAME Copy Monitor CPMs with New Relic Infrastructure New Relic's infrastructure monitoring supports advanced Docker monitoring and advanced Kubernetes monitoring. To add support for this, synthetic monitoring labels the containers spawned by CPM with a series of informative labels, all prefixed with synthetics-minion-. The CPM spawns containers called \"runners\" which process non-ping monitors like: simple browser, scripted browser, api test, and step function. You can use these labels to identify these runner containers. Example labels include: synthetics-minion-runner-role synthetics-minion-runner-version synthetics-minion-container-id synthetics-minion-id synthetics-minion-build-number synthetics-minion-job synthetics-minion-account synthetics-minion-monitor synthetics-minion-monitor-version synthetics-minion-monitor-type synthetics-minion-monitor-type-label Runner containers last a short time. One runner container is created to process one non-ping monitor job. The runner is created, processes the job, and is quickly deleted. A runner container exists for only a few seconds and will be created only if there is a non-ping monitor job to process. Ping monitors will not trigger runner container creation, so the above labels will not be present. If you are using the infrastructure agent to monitor these runner containers, configure at least one monitor to run each minute. The infrastructure agent will have more opportunity to notice and collect the above labels from the docker inspect of the container before it is deleted. Note: the synthetics-minion-id label refers to the ID of the minion which spawned this particular runner container. The ID of the runner itself is not tracked.",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

For a detailed guide to all the available functions, see Synthetic's scripted browser reference. Tip To view other scripted browser examples, check out the Quickstarts Synthetics library in New Relic’s Github repository. You may also view tips from New Relic support engineers in the Level Up Relic Solutions section of the New Relic Online Technical Community. Monitor a URL In this example, the monitor visits http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/: //Visit http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/ $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\"); Copy This scripting action is the foundation for nearly all scripted browsers. For more information, see Visit a URL. Navigate to a link In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/. Finds the About page via link text and clicks the link. Finds the Acme Telco Home link by searching for the partial string Home and clicks the link. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ //Find a link whose display text is `About` and click that link. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText(\"About\")).click(); }).then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.partialLinkText(\"Home\")).click(); }); Copy These steps are ordered by a sequencing function. For detailed instructions and other methods of locating elements, see Locate elements. For a list of all locators, see Locators: Find page elements. Search a website In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp. Locates the search box via its XPath and types relic. Locates the submit button via its XPath and clicks it to submit the search. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the search field by specifying its id, then enter `relic`. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div/input\")).sendKeys(\"relic\"); }).then(function(){ //Click the search button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div//button\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about sending text to a field, see Enter text. Wait for a page to load In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/browse/phones. Finds the Details button for the Acme Standard phone via its XPath and clicks on it. Waits up to 10 seconds for the HTML page title to match Acme Commerce Company. Finds the Add to Cart button via its XPath and clicks on it. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/browse/phones\").then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"(//a[text()='Details'])[3]\")).click(); }); //Call the wait function. $browser.wait(function() { //Tell the monitor to get the page title, then run a function on that title. return $browser.getTitle().then(function(title) { //Ensure that the title matches `Acme Commerce Company`. return title === \"Acme Commerce Company\"; }); //If the condition isn't satisfied within 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), proceed anyway. }, 10000); //Find the `Add to Cart` button via its XPath and click it. $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//input[@value='Add to Cart']\")).click(); Copy For more information about setting wait conditions that will pause the script, see Wait for page title. Wait for a page element In the example below, the monitor: Loads http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/. Finds the Support dropdown via HTML ID and clicks on it. Waits up to 20 seconds for the FAQ button to appear and clicks on it. //Navigate to the Acme Telco Homepage and clicks on the Support dropdown. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.id(\"supportDropDown\")).click(); }).then(function(){ //Call the wait function to wait until the FAQ button appears. return $browser.waitForAndFindElement($driver.By.id(\"supportFAQLink\"), 2000).then(function(aboutPage){ return aboutPage.click(); }) }); Copy For more information, see Wait for a specific element and Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions. Log in to a website In the example below, the monitor: Loads http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp. Finds the username field through element name and submits a secure username via our secure credentials feature. Finds the password field through the element name and submits a secure password. Finds the login button via its XPath and clicks to submit the account information. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the user name field by specifying its name, then submits a secured username. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"username\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_USERNAME); }).then(function(){ //Find the password field by specifying its name, then submits a secured password. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"password\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_PASSWORD); }).then(function(){ //Find and click the login button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//input[@value='Login']\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about using secure credentials, see Store secure credentials. Tip What credentials should I use? Just like you shouldn't reuse a password across multiple websites, we recommend that you create new credentials unique to your script. Don't use your personal credentials or reuse credentials.

If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Description $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence. Return value: void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime.

Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Description $browser.manage().addCookie(spec: object) Schedules a command to add a cookie. spec is a record object describing a browser cookie. For more information, see the Selenium documentation. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present.

Return value: promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement. Call them through $driver.By. Function Description $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. Return value: locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. Return value: locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. Return value: locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. Return value: locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression.

Return value: locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Return value: locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. For example, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Description click() Clicks on this element. Return value: self reference sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. Return value: WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. Return value: WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). Return value: promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. Return value: promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. Return value: promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. Return value: promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. Return value: promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. Return value: promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. Return value: promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. Return value: promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. Return value: promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. Return value: promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation on GitHub. Function Description click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). Return value: actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. Return value: actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a drag and drop maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. Return value: actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. Return value: actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). Return value: actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). Return value: actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. Return value: promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation on GitHub. Return value: actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, finally() and catch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Description isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. Return value: boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. Return value: promise finally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. Return value: promise catch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. Return value: promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Description back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void refresh() Refresh the current page. Return value: void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). Return value: void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Tip You can learn more about waits in Selenium here. Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information, see Selenium's WebDriver until documentation. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Description ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. Return value: condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. Return value: condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. Return value: condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. Return value: condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. Return value: condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. Return value: condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. Return value: condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition n elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. Return value: condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. Return value: condition n elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. Return value: condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM or a new page has loaded. Return value: condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. Return value: condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. Return value: condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

Finds the Add to Cart button via its XPath and clicks on it. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/browse/phones\").then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"(//a[text()='Details'])[3]\")).click(); }); //Call the wait function. $browser.wait(function() { //Tell the monitor to get the page title, then run a function on that title. return $browser.getTitle().then(function(title) { //Ensure that the title matches `Acme Commerce Company`. return title === \"Acme Commerce Company\"; }); //If the condition isn't satisfied within 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), proceed anyway. }, 10000); //Find the `Add to Cart` button via its XPath and click it. $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//input[@value='Add to Cart']\")).click(); Copy For more information about setting wait conditions that will pause the script, see Wait for page title. Wait for a page element In the example below, the monitor: Loads http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/. Finds the Support dropdown via HTML ID and clicks on it. Waits up to 20 seconds for the FAQ button to appear and clicks on it. //Navigate to the Acme Telco Homepage and clicks on the Support dropdown. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.id(\"supportDropDown\")).click(); }).then(function(){ //Call the wait function to wait until the FAQ button appears. return $browser.waitForAndFindElement($driver.By.id(\"supportFAQLink\"), 2000).then(function(aboutPage){ return aboutPage.click(); }) }); Copy For more information, see Wait for a specific element and Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions. Log in to a website In the example below, the monitor: Loads http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp. Finds the username field through element name and submits a secure username via our secure credentials feature. Finds the password field through the element name and submits a secure password. Finds the login button via its XPath and clicks to submit the account information. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the user name field by specifying its name, then submits a secured username. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"username\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_USERNAME); }).then(function(){ //Find the password field by specifying its name, then submits a secured password. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"password\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_PASSWORD); }).then(function(){ //Find and click the login button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//input[@value='Login']\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about using secure credentials, see Store secure credentials. Tip What credentials should I use? Just like you shouldn't reuse a password across multiple websites, we recommend that you create new credentials unique to your script. Don't use your personal credentials or reuse credentials.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's $util.insights is a set of tools to set and manipulate events reported from synthetic monitoring. The $util.insights toolset includes the word insights because Insights was historically how New Relic saved queryable event data.

      "body": "This document describes scripted browser functions available for synthetic monitors versions 0.5.x or higher. If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions.

Return value: WebElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. Return value: promise Deny list: Wildcard use If you want to add domains to the deny list for your browser instance, the wildcards must match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com deny list must contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance, such as cookies, timeouts, and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Description $browser.manage().addCookie(spec: object) Schedules a command to add a cookie. spec is a record object describing a browser cookie. For more information, see the Selenium documentation. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen.

Return value: locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. Return value: locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Return value: locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. For example, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Description click() Clicks on this element. Return value: self reference sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. Return value: WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. Return value: WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). Return value: promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. Return value: promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. Return value: promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. Return value: promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. Return value: promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. Return value: promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. Return value: promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. Return value: promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. Return value: promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. Return value: promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation on GitHub. Function Description click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). Return value: actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. Return value: actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a drag and drop maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. Return value: actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. Return value: actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). Return value: actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). Return value: actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. Return value: promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation on GitHub. Return value: actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, finally() and catch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Description isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. Return value: boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. Return value: promise finally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. Return value: promise catch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. Return value: promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Description back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void refresh() Refresh the current page. Return value: void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). Return value: void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Tip You can learn more about waits in Selenium here. Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information, see Selenium's WebDriver until documentation. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Description ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. Return value: condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. Return value: condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. Return value: condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. Return value: condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. Return value: condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. Return value: condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. Return value: condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition n elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. Return value: condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. Return value: condition n elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. Return value: condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM or a new page has loaded. Return value: condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. Return value: condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. Return value: condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. Return value: condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Write scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples such as searching a website and waiting for results to load) Script repository in New Relic's Explorers Hub (example scripts tagged synthetics-script, created and shared by our online technical community)",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

For a detailed guide to all the available functions, see Synthetic's scripted browser reference. Tip To view other scripted browser examples, check out the Quickstarts Synthetics library in New Relic’s Github repository. You may also view tips from New Relic support engineers in the Level Up Relic Solutions section of the New Relic Online Technical Community. Monitor a URL In this example, the monitor visits http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/: //Visit http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/ $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\"); Copy This scripting action is the foundation for nearly all scripted browsers. For more information, see Visit a URL. Navigate to a link In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/. Finds the About page via link text and clicks the link. Finds the Acme Telco Home link by searching for the partial string Home and clicks the link. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ //Find a link whose display text is `About` and click that link. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText(\"About\")).click(); }).then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.partialLinkText(\"Home\")).click(); }); Copy These steps are ordered by a sequencing function. For detailed instructions and other methods of locating elements, see Locate elements. For a list of all locators, see Locators: Find page elements. Search a website In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp. Locates the search box via its XPath and types relic. Locates the submit button via its XPath and clicks it to submit the search. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the search field by specifying its id, then enter `relic`. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div/input\")).sendKeys(\"relic\"); }).then(function(){ //Click the search button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div//button\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about sending text to a field, see Enter text. Wait for a page to load In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/browse/phones. Finds the Details button for the Acme Standard phone via its XPath and clicks on it. Waits up to 10 seconds for the HTML page title to match Acme Commerce Company.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's $util.insights is a set of tools to set and manipulate events reported from synthetic monitoring. The $util.insights toolset includes the word insights because Insights was historically how New Relic saved queryable event data. You can add custom data as custom attributes, with the prefix custom, to the SyntheticCheck event. These attributes are in addition to the event's default attributes. Compatibility This functionality is available for monitor versions 0.2.0 or later. Functions Function Return value $util.insights.set(key: string, value: ?) Sets a key/value pair. void $util.insights.get(key: string) Returns the value for the provided key. object $util.insights.getKeys() Returns an array of keys currently set. object $util.insights.has(key: string) Returns true if the key exists in the data. boolean $util.insights.unset(key: string) Removes the key/value pair. void $util.insights.unsetAll() Removes all custom data. void Example The example obtains the latest incident from New Relic's RSS status feed and saves the details for this event. var parseString = require('xml2js').parseString; // Get the New Relic status RSS feed $http.get('https://status.newrelic.com/history.rss', function(err, response, body) { parseString(body, function(err, result){ // Parse the RSS, and get the latest incident var latestIncident = result.rss.channel[0].item[0]; // Push the incident details to New Relic $util.insights.set('Incident', latestIncident.title[0]); $util.insights.set('Description', latestIncident.description[0]); $util.insights.set('Date', latestIncident.pubDate[0]); }); }); Copy To view the incident data sent to New Relic in this example, use this query: FROM SyntheticCheck SELECT latest(custom.Date), latest(custom.Incident), latest(custom.Description) WHERE monitorName = \"Monitor Name Here\" Copy",

You may also view tips from New Relic support engineers in the Level Up Relic Solutions section of the New Relic Online Technical Community. Monitor a URL In this example, the monitor visits http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/: //Visit http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/ $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\"); Copy This scripting action is the foundation for nearly all scripted browsers. For more information, see Visit a URL. Navigate to a link In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/. Finds the About page via link text and clicks the link. Finds the Acme Telco Home link by searching for the partial string Home and clicks the link. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ //Find a link whose display text is `About` and click that link. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.linkText(\"About\")).click(); }).then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.partialLinkText(\"Home\")).click(); }); Copy These steps are ordered by a sequencing function. For detailed instructions and other methods of locating elements, see Locate elements. For a list of all locators, see Locators: Find page elements. Search a website In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp. Locates the search box via its XPath and types relic. Locates the submit button via its XPath and clicks it to submit the search. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/static/companyBlog.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the search field by specifying its id, then enter `relic`. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div/input\")).sendKeys(\"relic\"); }).then(function(){ //Click the search button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//h4[text()='Blog Search']/following-sibling::div//button\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about sending text to a field, see Enter text. Wait for a page to load In the example below, the monitor: Navigates to http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/browse/phones.

Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights POST example This example POSTs a custom Insights event containing static integers: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Insights validation example This example POSTs to the Insights API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myInsertKey = '{INSERT_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define insert key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Insert-Key': myInsertKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

Waits up to 20 seconds for the FAQ button to appear and clicks on it. //Navigate to the Acme Telco Homepage and clicks on the Support dropdown. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/\").then(function(){ return $browser.findElement($driver.By.id(\"supportDropDown\")).click(); }).then(function(){ //Call the wait function to wait until the FAQ button appears. return $browser.waitForAndFindElement($driver.By.id(\"supportFAQLink\"), 2000).then(function(aboutPage){ return aboutPage.click(); }) }); Copy For more information, see Wait for a specific element and Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions. Log in to a website In the example below, the monitor: Loads http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp. Finds the username field through element name and submits a secure username via our secure credentials feature. Finds the password field through the element name and submits a secure password. Finds the login button via its XPath and clicks to submit the account information. $browser.get(\"http://telco.nrdemo-sandbox.com/login.jsp\").then(function(){ //Find the user name field by specifying its name, then submits a secured username. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"username\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_USERNAME); }).then(function(){ //Find the password field by specifying its name, then submits a secured password. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.name(\"password\")).sendKeys($secure.SECURE_PASSWORD); }).then(function(){ //Find and click the login button. return $browser.findElement($driver.By.xpath(\"//input[@value='Login']\")).click(); }); Copy For more information about using secure credentials, see Store secure credentials. Tip What credentials should I use? Just like you shouldn't reuse a password across multiple websites, we recommend that you create new credentials unique to your script. Don't use your personal credentials or reuse credentials.

      "body": "This document describes scripted browser functions available for synthetic monitors versions 0.5.x or higher. If you are using older monitor versions, see the monitor version 0.4.0 and lower documentation. For more on monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. Selenium Webdriver APIs The synthetic scripted browsers provide access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.6.0 for monitor version 0.6.x and Selenium Webdriver APIs 3.5.0 for monitor version 0.5.x via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic monitoring instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(). It exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Description $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence. Return value: void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. Return value: void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in the argument from runtime. Return value: void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Adds a hostname to your deny list. Allows using wildcards. Return value: void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Adds all hostnames in an array of arguments to your deny list. Allows using wildcards. Return value: void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Adds a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring to your allow list. Return value: void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Adds all hostnames in the argument to your allow list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname for this browser instance from your deny list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your deny list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname for this browser instance from your allow list. Return value: void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in the argument from your allow list for this browser instance. Return value: void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. Return value: promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. Return value: promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, synthetic monitoring returns an error. The timeout value is optional. It is applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). Return value: WebElementPromise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. Return value: promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. Return value: promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. Return value: promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. Return value: promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. Return value: map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM. Do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. Return value: promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. Return value: promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. Return value: promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. Return value: promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. Return value: void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. Return value: void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. Return value: promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time.

Return value: promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by your supplied function. Return value: WebElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. Return value: promise Deny list: Wildcard use If you want to add domains to the deny list for your browser instance, the wildcards must match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com deny list must contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance, such as cookies, timeouts, and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Description $browser.manage().addCookie(spec: object) Schedules a command to add a cookie. spec is a record object describing a browser cookie. For more information, see the Selenium documentation. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. Return value: promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. Return value: promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement. Call them through $driver.By. Function Description $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. Return value: locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. Return value: locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. Return value: locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. Return value: locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. Return value: locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. Return value: locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. Return value: locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. Return value: locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. Return value: locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. For example, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Description click() Clicks on this element. Return value: self reference sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. Return value: WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. Return value: WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). Return value: promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. Return value: promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. Return value: promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. Return value: promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. Return value: promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. Return value: promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. Return value: promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. Return value: promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. Return value: promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. Return value: promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation on GitHub. Function Description click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). Return value: actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. Return value: actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a drag and drop maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. Return value: actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. Return value: actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. Return value: actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). Return value: actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). Return value: actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. Return value: promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation on GitHub. Return value: actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, finally() and catch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Description isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. Return value: boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. Return value: promise finally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. Return value: promise catch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. Return value: promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Description back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. Return value: void refresh() Refresh the current page. Return value: void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). Return value: void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Tip You can learn more about waits in Selenium here. Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information, see Selenium's WebDriver until documentation. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Description ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. Return value: condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. Return value: condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. Return value: condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. Return value: condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. Return value: condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. Return value: condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. Return value: condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. Return value: condition n elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. Return value: condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. Return value: condition n elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. Return value: condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM or a new page has loaded. Return value: condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. Return value: condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. Return value: condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

      "body": "Problem Your synthetic ping or simple monitor reported one of these errors. For scripted monitor errors, see non-ping errors. Solutions These are some of the most common non-scripted monitor error messages. ERROR: Job timed out after 65 seconds Problem Your ping timed out after 65 seconds, the non-configurable check duration time limit. Solution The 65 second time limit is non-configurable. Pings exceeding 65 seconds may be a result of latency from the target server. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause Ping monitors will first perform a HEAD request. If this request fails for any reason, or reaches the 30 second HTTP connect timeout for ping monitors, then a subsequent GET request is performed. This error happens when both the HEAD and GET request exceed 30 seconds, usually due to server latency. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: connect timed out Problem HTTP requests during the check exceeded the non-configurable 30 second TCP connection timeout limit. Solution The 30 second time limit is non-configurable. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This failure indicates an issue reaching your site from the location where the synthetic's check was performed. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: Connection refused Problem The target server refused connection from the synthetic ping monitor HTTP client. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause The target server is likely blocking or rate-limiting synthetic's traffic. HTTPError: Server replied with HTTP XXX response code Problem The synthetic monitor encountered an unsuccessful status code, usually a response code that is not in the 2XX/3XX range. Solution Check your server-side logging to determine why the response code was sent. To assist with identifying synthetic's traffic on your server, all synthetic monitoring traffic includes an X-Abuse-Info HTTP request header and we provide a list of origin IP addresses for all synthetic monitoring traffic. Cause The cause depends on the response code sent. SSLVerificationError: (ERROR) Problem Your monitor returns an SSLVerificationError. Solution Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Settings > General > Advanced options, then disable the Verify SSL check. Cause SSLVerificationError failures are a result of the optional Verify SSL check failing against the target host. SSL verification failed during execution for domain <TARGET_URL> failures indicate that the URL provided is not HTTPS or does not redirect to an HTTPS endpoint. SSLVerificationError: (<ERROR CODE>) <ERROR> errors are retrieved directly from the openssl command and often indicate a legitimate SSL configuration issue on the target site. ResponseValidationError: Response did not contain the expected string Problem The string value included in the synthetic monitor’s optional Response Validation field was not found in the target server’s response. Solution To troubleshoot: Check the failed results timeline to ensure the endpoint where the response validation text is expected, is the last endpoint being requested. Attempt a curl request against the target endpoint to see if the expected response body is returned. Ensure your endpoint doesn't have policies that will return different content depending on header content or request activity. If so, use a scripted browser to spoof a specific header string. If you’re using a simple browser to monitor a page whose content is loaded via JavaScript after the page’s load event is fired, consider using a scripted browser monitor instead. You can program scripted browsers to wait for specific elements to appear on a page before interacting with them. Cause The cause depends on the monitor type: Ping monitors: The string value must be present in the first 1MB (10^6 bytes) of the response body. Simple browsers: The string must be visible on the page when the page’s load event is fired. NetworkError: Read timed out Problem The monitor client was able to establish an HTTP connection to the target site, but then exceeded the 30 second read timeout while waiting for a response. Solution To troubleshoot: Investigate the target server's performance during the time period the issue was observed. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This indicates an issue with the target server responding to the synthetic monitor HTTP client, or network latency between your server and ours. NetworkError: Socket is closed Problem The synthetic monitor's HTTP client was able to establish a connection to the target server. The target server then closed the connection without a response. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause Edge infrastructure sometimes implements measures such as this for an application endpoint to handle traffic that violates behavior policies like rate limiting. NetworkError: No route to host (Host unreachable) Problem The synthetic monitoring client was able to resolve the target host’s IP address, but it was unable to find a route to the target host to establish a connection. Solution If the failure is occurring on a public synthetic monitoring's location, ensure that the DNS records for this host are resolving to a reachable IP address. If the failure is occurring on a synthetic monitoring's private location, ensure the private minion’s network configuration is properly configured and that the target hostname is resolvable and reachable via the private minion virtual command line interface. Cause This occurs when the target hostname resolves to a non-routable IP address per RFC 1918. HTTPError: Server sent us too many redirects (20) Problem The synthetic monitor client was redirected (observing 301 or 302 response codes) 20 times when performing a request to the target endpoint. Solution Ensure that the target endpoint redirects client requests less than 20 times. If this is only occurring within New Relic, recreate the issue outside New Relic to troubleshoot the root cause. Use a similar client to perform requests against the target endpoint: Ping monitors: HTTP client similar to curl. Simple/Browser based monitors: Chrome 60 instance in an Ubuntu 14.04.5 VM. Scripted API monitors: Use the request HTTP client for Node.js. Cause This occurs when the monitored endpoint effectively serves a redirect loop to the synthetic monitor: The initial response redirects to another URL which redirects to another URL, etc. NetworkError: DNS resolution failed for host: (HOST) Problem The target hostname was not able to be resolved by the synthetic monitor’s HTTP client. Solution Private synthetic monitoring's locations: Confirm that the network configuration for the minion is correct. If the target hostname is an internal one, ensure that the minion is using your network’s internal DNS service that is able to resolve the host. The containerized private minion and the runner containers it spawns on host (to run non-ping checks) should inherit DNS configuration from the host /etc/resolv.conf. Docker: Network arguments like –dns or -network used in the Docker run command on the containerized private minion will only be used by the minion container but not the runner containers. If the DNS points to the loopback interface such as 127.0.0.1, define a DNS config at the Docker daemon level, or use a tool like dnsmasq to make sure the runner will forward DNS requests on the Docker bridge interface. Public synthetic monitoring locations: Ensure that the target site’s DNS record can be looked up by public DNS services such as Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. Cause Our public synthetic monitoring locations use Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. If DNS resolution of the target host is failing on our public synthetic monitoring locations, this is likely an issue other users are facing. If you are seeing DNS resolution related monitor failures on a synthetic monitoring private location, this is often caused by the private minion for that location having an invalid network configuration. BlockedRequestError: (URL) Problem The target domain is blocked by synthetic monitoring. Solution To unblock domains, you must use a scripted browser monitor and manually make calls in your script. Cause Synthetic monitoring specifically exclude scripts for popular analytics services such as Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive accurate data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Tip To use synthetic monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Cause Ping monitors will first perform a HEAD request. If this request fails for any reason, or reaches the 30 second HTTP connect timeout for ping monitors, then a subsequent GET request is performed. This error happens when both the HEAD and GET request exceed 30 seconds, usually due to server latency. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: connect timed out Problem HTTP requests during the check exceeded the non-configurable 30 second TCP connection timeout limit. Solution The 30 second time limit is non-configurable. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This failure indicates an issue reaching your site from the location where the synthetic's check was performed. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: Connection refused Problem The target server refused connection from the synthetic ping monitor HTTP client. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause The target server is likely blocking or rate-limiting synthetic's traffic. HTTPError: Server replied with HTTP XXX response code Problem The synthetic monitor encountered an unsuccessful status code, usually a response code that is not in the 2XX/3XX range. Solution Check your server-side logging to determine why the response code was sent. To assist with identifying synthetic's traffic on your server, all synthetic monitoring traffic includes an X-Abuse-Info HTTP request header and we provide a list of origin IP addresses for all synthetic monitoring traffic. Cause The cause depends on the response code sent. SSLVerificationError: (ERROR) Problem Your monitor returns an SSLVerificationError. Solution Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Settings > General > Advanced options, then disable the Verify SSL check. Cause SSLVerificationError failures are a result of the optional Verify SSL check failing against the target host. SSL verification failed during execution for domain <TARGET_URL> failures indicate that the URL provided is not HTTPS or does not redirect to an HTTPS endpoint. SSLVerificationError: (<ERROR CODE>) <ERROR> errors are retrieved directly from the openssl command and often indicate a legitimate SSL configuration issue on the target site. ResponseValidationError: Response did not contain the expected string Problem The string value included in the synthetic monitor’s optional Response Validation field was not found in the target server’s response. Solution To troubleshoot: Check the failed results timeline to ensure the endpoint where the response validation text is expected, is the last endpoint being requested. Attempt a curl request against the target endpoint to see if the expected response body is returned. Ensure your endpoint doesn't have policies that will return different content depending on header content or request activity. If so, use a scripted browser to spoof a specific header string. If you’re using a simple browser to monitor a page whose content is loaded via JavaScript after the page’s load event is fired, consider using a scripted browser monitor instead. You can program scripted browsers to wait for specific elements to appear on a page before interacting with them. Cause The cause depends on the monitor type: Ping monitors: The string value must be present in the first 1MB (10^6 bytes) of the response body. Simple browsers: The string must be visible on the page when the page’s load event is fired. NetworkError: Read timed out Problem The monitor client was able to establish an HTTP connection to the target site, but then exceeded the 30 second read timeout while waiting for a response. Solution To troubleshoot: Investigate the target server's performance during the time period the issue was observed. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This indicates an issue with the target server responding to the synthetic monitor HTTP client, or network latency between your server and ours. NetworkError: Socket is closed Problem The synthetic monitor's HTTP client was able to establish a connection to the target server. The target server then closed the connection without a response. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause Edge infrastructure sometimes implements measures such as this for an application endpoint to handle traffic that violates behavior policies like rate limiting. NetworkError: No route to host (Host unreachable) Problem The synthetic monitoring client was able to resolve the target host’s IP address, but it was unable to find a route to the target host to establish a connection. Solution If the failure is occurring on a public synthetic monitoring's location, ensure that the DNS records for this host are resolving to a reachable IP address. If the failure is occurring on a synthetic monitoring's private location, ensure the private minion’s network configuration is properly configured and that the target hostname is resolvable and reachable via the private minion virtual command line interface. Cause This occurs when the target hostname resolves to a non-routable IP address per RFC 1918. HTTPError: Server sent us too many redirects (20) Problem The synthetic monitor client was redirected (observing 301 or 302 response codes) 20 times when performing a request to the target endpoint. Solution Ensure that the target endpoint redirects client requests less than 20 times. If this is only occurring within New Relic, recreate the issue outside New Relic to troubleshoot the root cause. Use a similar client to perform requests against the target endpoint: Ping monitors: HTTP client similar to curl. Simple/Browser based monitors: Chrome 60 instance in an Ubuntu 14.04.5 VM. Scripted API monitors: Use the request HTTP client for Node.js. Cause This occurs when the monitored endpoint effectively serves a redirect loop to the synthetic monitor: The initial response redirects to another URL which redirects to another URL, etc. NetworkError: DNS resolution failed for host: (HOST) Problem The target hostname was not able to be resolved by the synthetic monitor’s HTTP client. Solution Private synthetic monitoring's locations: Confirm that the network configuration for the minion is correct. If the target hostname is an internal one, ensure that the minion is using your network’s internal DNS service that is able to resolve the host. The containerized private minion and the runner containers it spawns on host (to run non-ping checks) should inherit DNS configuration from the host /etc/resolv.conf. Docker: Network arguments like –dns or -network used in the Docker run command on the containerized private minion will only be used by the minion container but not the runner containers. If the DNS points to the loopback interface such as 127.0.0.1, define a DNS config at the Docker daemon level, or use a tool like dnsmasq to make sure the runner will forward DNS requests on the Docker bridge interface. Public synthetic monitoring locations: Ensure that the target site’s DNS record can be looked up by public DNS services such as Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. Cause Our public synthetic monitoring locations use Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. If DNS resolution of the target host is failing on our public synthetic monitoring locations, this is likely an issue other users are facing. If you are seeing DNS resolution related monitor failures on a synthetic monitoring private location, this is often caused by the private minion for that location having an invalid network configuration. BlockedRequestError: (URL) Problem The target domain is blocked by synthetic monitoring. Solution To unblock domains, you must use a scripted browser monitor and manually make calls in your script. Cause Synthetic monitoring specifically exclude scripts for popular analytics services such as Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive accurate data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month.",

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Cause Ping monitors will first perform a HEAD request. If this request fails for any reason, or reaches the 30 second HTTP connect timeout for ping monitors, then a subsequent GET request is performed. This error happens when both the HEAD and GET request exceed 30 seconds, usually due to server latency. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: connect timed out Problem HTTP requests during the check exceeded the non-configurable 30 second TCP connection timeout limit. Solution The 30 second time limit is non-configurable. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This failure indicates an issue reaching your site from the location where the synthetic's check was performed. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: Connection refused Problem The target server refused connection from the synthetic ping monitor HTTP client. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause The target server is likely blocking or rate-limiting synthetic's traffic. HTTPError: Server replied with HTTP XXX response code Problem The synthetic monitor encountered an unsuccessful status code, usually a response code that is not in the 2XX/3XX range. Solution Check your server-side logging to determine why the response code was sent. To assist with identifying synthetic's traffic on your server, all synthetic monitoring traffic includes an X-Abuse-Info HTTP request header and we provide a list of origin IP addresses for all synthetic monitoring traffic. Cause The cause depends on the response code sent. SSLVerificationError: (ERROR) Problem Your monitor returns an SSLVerificationError. Solution Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Settings > General > Advanced options, then disable the Verify SSL check. Cause SSLVerificationError failures are a result of the optional Verify SSL check failing against the target host. SSL verification failed during execution for domain <TARGET_URL> failures indicate that the URL provided is not HTTPS or does not redirect to an HTTPS endpoint. SSLVerificationError: (<ERROR CODE>) <ERROR> errors are retrieved directly from the openssl command and often indicate a legitimate SSL configuration issue on the target site. ResponseValidationError: Response did not contain the expected string Problem The string value included in the synthetic monitor’s optional Response Validation field was not found in the target server’s response. Solution To troubleshoot: Check the failed results timeline to ensure the endpoint where the response validation text is expected, is the last endpoint being requested. Attempt a curl request against the target endpoint to see if the expected response body is returned. Ensure your endpoint doesn't have policies that will return different content depending on header content or request activity. If so, use a scripted browser to spoof a specific header string. If you’re using a simple browser to monitor a page whose content is loaded via JavaScript after the page’s load event is fired, consider using a scripted browser monitor instead. You can program scripted browsers to wait for specific elements to appear on a page before interacting with them. Cause The cause depends on the monitor type: Ping monitors: The string value must be present in the first 1MB (10^6 bytes) of the response body. Simple browsers: The string must be visible on the page when the page’s load event is fired. NetworkError: Read timed out Problem The monitor client was able to establish an HTTP connection to the target site, but then exceeded the 30 second read timeout while waiting for a response. Solution To troubleshoot: Investigate the target server's performance during the time period the issue was observed. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This indicates an issue with the target server responding to the synthetic monitor HTTP client, or network latency between your server and ours. NetworkError: Socket is closed Problem The synthetic monitor's HTTP client was able to establish a connection to the target server. The target server then closed the connection without a response. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause Edge infrastructure sometimes implements measures such as this for an application endpoint to handle traffic that violates behavior policies like rate limiting. NetworkError: No route to host (Host unreachable) Problem The synthetic monitoring client was able to resolve the target host’s IP address, but it was unable to find a route to the target host to establish a connection. Solution If the failure is occurring on a public synthetic monitoring's location, ensure that the DNS records for this host are resolving to a reachable IP address. If the failure is occurring on a synthetic monitoring's private location, ensure the private minion’s network configuration is properly configured and that the target hostname is resolvable and reachable via the private minion virtual command line interface. Cause This occurs when the target hostname resolves to a non-routable IP address per RFC 1918. HTTPError: Server sent us too many redirects (20) Problem The synthetic monitor client was redirected (observing 301 or 302 response codes) 20 times when performing a request to the target endpoint. Solution Ensure that the target endpoint redirects client requests less than 20 times. If this is only occurring within New Relic, recreate the issue outside New Relic to troubleshoot the root cause. Use a similar client to perform requests against the target endpoint: Ping monitors: HTTP client similar to curl. Simple/Browser based monitors: Chrome 60 instance in an Ubuntu 14.04.5 VM. Scripted API monitors: Use the request HTTP client for Node.js. Cause This occurs when the monitored endpoint effectively serves a redirect loop to the synthetic monitor: The initial response redirects to another URL which redirects to another URL, etc. NetworkError: DNS resolution failed for host: (HOST) Problem The target hostname was not able to be resolved by the synthetic monitor’s HTTP client. Solution Private synthetic monitoring's locations: Confirm that the network configuration for the minion is correct. If the target hostname is an internal one, ensure that the minion is using your network’s internal DNS service that is able to resolve the host. The containerized private minion and the runner containers it spawns on host (to run non-ping checks) should inherit DNS configuration from the host /etc/resolv.conf. Docker: Network arguments like –dns or -network used in the Docker run command on the containerized private minion will only be used by the minion container but not the runner containers. If the DNS points to the loopback interface such as 127.0.0.1, define a DNS config at the Docker daemon level, or use a tool like dnsmasq to make sure the runner will forward DNS requests on the Docker bridge interface. Public synthetic monitoring locations: Ensure that the target site’s DNS record can be looked up by public DNS services such as Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. Cause Our public synthetic monitoring locations use Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. If DNS resolution of the target host is failing on our public synthetic monitoring locations, this is likely an issue other users are facing. If you are seeing DNS resolution related monitor failures on a synthetic monitoring private location, this is often caused by the private minion for that location having an invalid network configuration. BlockedRequestError: (URL) Problem The target domain is blocked by synthetic monitoring. Solution To unblock domains, you must use a scripted browser monitor and manually make calls in your script. Cause Synthetic monitoring specifically exclude scripts for popular analytics services such as Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive accurate data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. Follow the UI instructions to add, edit, or delete a secure credential, then save any additions or changes you make. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials user interface shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load. See a history of monitor changes You can use New Relic One to see a history of recent changes to synthetic monitors and what users changed them.",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. Follow the UI instructions to add, edit, or delete a secure credential, then save any additions or changes you make. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials user interface shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. Follow the UI instructions to add, edit, or delete a secure credential, then save any additions or changes you make. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials user interface shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your Scripted Browser or API Test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in the account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys).

Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in the account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics?

However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure.

To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation.

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Start and stop interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest New Relic Mobile SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them.

Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic Mobile. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in New Relic Mobile's Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it in New Relic Mobile. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, New Relic Mobile will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if New Relic Mobile records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of the codes that New Relic Mobile supports, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in New Relic Mobile's Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it in New Relic Mobile. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, New Relic Mobile will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if New Relic Mobile records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of the codes that New Relic Mobile supports, see NRConstants.h.",

Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs.

Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period.

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less.

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics.

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics.

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys).

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys).

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys).

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.)

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. Tip To use NRDB and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Manage all your data We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. But we also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Data management hub. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data can be uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements can be dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data Our Telemetry Data Platform is the single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more information about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage (NrDailyUsage) To view daily usage of New Relic for your selected account for billing purposes, query NrDailyUsage events. For more information about available NrDailyUsageattributes, see our data dictionary. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by Browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Insights The Insights service reports on data recorded by other New Relic products and services. It doesn’t record data on its own. For more information, see the Insights documentation about default data from other products and services. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Open source on-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our Logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the Logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The Logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. New Relic One New Relic One is a connected, unified UI that gathers all the data you already monitor with New Relic in one place. It is not a product, but rather, it's a way to interact with all your New Relic data more easily. For more information, see the introduction and security documentation for New Relic One. Plugins The plugins service allows you to publish publicly accessible plugins within (Plugin Central. Anyone who has a New Relic account can install and use these plugins through their New Relic user interface. For some plugins, New Relic, Inc. is the publisher, and will be clearly identified as the publisher in Plugin Central. For plugins in Plugin Central that are not created by New Relic, the plugin publisher must follow specific guidelines. For more information, see the Plugins security documentation. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select Account settings. Select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, as well as Mobile REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key.

Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For accounts that have sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Requirements: Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key.

Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",
