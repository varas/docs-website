      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "To take full advantage of our latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Python agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Python agent release notes. Update with Python package index (PyPi) The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic. To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service.

Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service.

Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent admin script is used during the installation process. When the Python agent package is installed, the newrelic-admin script is also installed into the bin directory of the Python installation or virtual environment. This document gives more in-depth detail about these uses of the admin script: Generating the initial agent configuration file Validating your config file Testing the connection to New Relic Wrapping startup of standalone Python web applications Subcommand structure To execute subcommands, provide the name of the subcommand as the first argument to the newrelic-admin script. Then add any options after the name of the subcommand. For example: newrelic-admin help Copy help < command> When executed with no further arguments, this provides a listing of all accepted subcommands: $ newrelic-admin help Usage: newrelic-admin command [options] Type 'newrelic-admin help <command>' for help on any of the commands listed in this document. To view additional details about a subcommand, run the help command with the subcommand and any of its options. For example: $ newrelic-admin help generate-config Usage: newrelic-admin generate-config license_key [output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file for <license_key> Copy generate-config license_key [ output_file] Generates a sample agent configuration file. The license_key option is your New Relic license key. By default the sample configuration file will be directed to standard output and be displayed on your screen. To capture the output, you can instead save it to a file by giving the name of the file as the output_file option. When the sample agent configuration file is generated, only the license key option in the file is updated. You should still edit the file and make changes to app_name and log_file options as appropriate. For more information, see Python agent installation. If you cannot run the generate-config command to produce the initial agent configuration file, you can download a sample configuration file from download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/newrelic.ini. validate-config config_file [ log_file] Validates the syntax of an agent configuration file given by the config_file option. This might be the agent configuration generated by generate-config and subsequently edited, or an agent configuration file created by downloading the sample configuration file from the download site. As well as validating the syntax of the configuration file, using the license_key contained in the agent configuration file to identify your account, will also test whether a connection can be made to the our servers. This subcommand can therefore be used to ensure that DNS is available for resolving the hostname of the our data collector host and that there is network connectivity available and that no firewall is blocking access. In connecting to the our servers, the test will create an application under your account called Python Agent Test. Into this application a small amount of simulated web transaction data and errors will be reported. After a period of time this application in your account will be able to be deleted from the Applications list if desired. When this test is run, a log file will be created in the location: /tmp/python-agent-test.log Copy If you need to override this location you can supply the log_file option. To have what would be written to the log file be displayed to your screen, you can use stdout or stderr as the value passed as the log_file option. When using a hosting service such as Heroku where an agent configuration file wouldn't normally be used, this subcommand can still be used to test the connection to us. For Heroku the license key information is defined in an environment variable automatically setup by Heroku when you add the New Relic addon to your Heroku instance. In this case where an environment variable is used to define the license key, to run the connectivity test, pass the value - for the config_file option in place of the path to the agent configuration file. So, to run the command on your Heroku instance you would use: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy Note that we have supplied stdout for the log file in this case, else it would be necessary to separately retrieve the log file generated. It is recommended that when setting up the Python agent for the first time, or even perhaps on a new host, that this subcommand be used to test whether data can be reported okay. For more information, see Testing the Python agent. run-program ... Executes the command line for a Python web application given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. Agent configuration when using this method can be provided in two different ways. If using a complete agent configuration file then the location of that configuration can be provided by the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you were using gunicorn for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn wsgi:application Copy When specifying the location of the configuration file using the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, the following additional environment variables can be set to customize how the configuration file is processed. NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT: The name of a specific deployment environment. When specified, additional override configuration will be read from a separate deployment section within the configuration file. The section of the configuration file for a specific deployment environment should be named as newrelic:environment where environment is replaced with the name being specified by this environment variable In place of a complete agent configuration file, you can also set environment variables providing only the key agent configuration information. The environment variables which can be set in this case are: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY - Your New Relic license key. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME - The name of the application you wish to report data against in the UI. If not defined, this defaults to Python Application. NEW_RELIC_LOG - The path to a file to be used for the agent log. If not defined then no logging will occur. Can also be set to stdout or stderr to have logging go to standard output or standard error for process. NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL - The level at which logging will be output by the agent. If not defined then defaults to info. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: critical, error, warning, info and debug. Individual environment variables are used when hosting your application on Heroku. The environment variables will be set automatically as appropriate by the Heroku environment when you add the New Relic addon. It is therefore not necessary when using Heroku to set any of the above environment variables when using the newrelic-admin command with this option from your Procfile. Note that the wrapped program must be using the same Python installation or virtual environment as that which the Python agent package and the newrelic-admin script was installed into. If this is not the case then the wrapper script will have no affect and you may even encounter an error on startup of the Python interpreter due to the newrelic Python package not being able to be found. If using sudo to startup your WSGI application as another user, be aware that the default sudo configuration will generally be such that user environment variables from the shell in which sudo is run will be ignored. In this case you would need to change the sudoers configuration to allow passing of the specific environment variables. Alternatively, create a shell script which sets the environment variables and runs your WSGI application under newrelic-admin. To start up your WSGI application as a different user, then run sudo on that script rather than directly on your WSGI application. The use of an additional wrapper script to set the environment variables and run your WSGI application under newrelic-admin may also be required when using supervisord if any issues are encountered with environment variable settings within the supervisord configuration not being passed through correctly. run-python ... Executes the python executable from the Python installation or virtual environment that newrelic-admin is installed into with the arguments given as ... but forces the initialization of the agent automatically at startup. This is a shortcut method for starting up a Python web application without needing to manually make changes to the web application to add code to specifically initialize the Python agent. It can be used in any situation where a Python web framework or WSGI server is used where instrumentation is being automatically added to wrap the WSGI application entry point. In other words, in situations where only the agent initialization code needed to be added. As for run-program subcommand above, environment variables are used to configure the Python agent. If you were using python executable directly for example, you could say: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy OR NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE newrelic-admin run-python wsgi.py Copy license-key config_file [ log_file] Outputs the license key which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the license key for the purpose of verifying that the correct value is being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin license-key newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting the license key using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY newrelic-admin license-key - Copy Output will be in the form: license_key = 'YOUR-LICENSE-KEY' Copy If no license key was found in the agent configuration file or picked up from user environment variables, the output will be: license_key = None Copy network-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the network configuration which will be used. This can be used in any startup scripts prior to starting up of the actual WSGI application to log the network configuration for the purpose of verifying that the correct values are being used. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin network-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any proxy information using environment variables, use - as the name of the configuration file: NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST=proxy.example.com export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT=8888 export NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT newrelic-admin network-config - Copy Output will be in the form: host = 'collector.newrelic.com' port = 0 proxy_host = 'proxy.example.com' proxy_port = 8888 proxy_user = None proxy_pass = None ssl = True Copy A value of 0 for port indicates that the port number, either 80 or 443, will be automatically selected based on whether an SSL connection is being used to communicate with our data collector. local-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the local agent configuration based on built-in defaults, environment variables, and any agent configuration file. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If setting any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin local-config - Copy server-config config_file [ log_file] Outputs the full configuration for a specific application. This will be the local agent configuration, overridden by any server-side configuration for the specific application. This information may be requested by our technical support when trying to debug any agent startup issues. It may be used with the agent configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config newrelic.ini Copy OR If changing any settings using environment variables, you can use - as the name of the configuration file: newrelic-admin server-config - Copy In order to obtain the server-side configuration, this script will force agent registration for the specific application defined by the configuration. If that application does not already appear in the user interface for APM, an entry for it will be created, but no metric data will be reported against it. record-deploy config_file description This is a wrapper around the New Relic REST API to record deployments for your application. You can also record deployments directly via the REST API. To use the command: Add your API key in the agent configuration file (newrelic.ini) by adding a line similar to the following in the [newrelic] section: api_key=substitute-your-api-key-here Copy Call the newrelic-admin command from the command line. (Do not add it to your config file.) using the following subcommand structure: newrelic-admin record-deploy config_file description [revision changelog user] Copy This subcommand has two required arguments: config_file: Path to the config file name description: Text to describe or identify the deployment; for example, the Git commit comments There are also three optional arguments: revision: Identifies a specific revision being deployed changelog: Provides a detailed log of what changes were made user: Identifies the person responsible for the deployment",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector.

If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.notice_error(error=None, attributes={}, expected=None, ignore=None, status_code=None, application=None) Copy Records details of a Python exception as an error. Description By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use notice_error to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the currently handled exception will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When notice_error() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, notice_error will require no parameters. Parameter Description error tuple Optional and rarely used. A tuple containing exception information (exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) returned from sys.exc_info(). attributes dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. expected boolean, iterable [String] , callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback)->boolean Optional. Errors to mark as expected can be passed in as an iterable of strings in the form module:class. This value can also be a callable or a Boolean indicating whether the error is expected. These errors will be reported to the UI but will not affect Apdex score or error rate. ignore boolean, iterable [String] , callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback)->boolean Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in as an iterable of strings in the form module:class. This value can also be a callable or a Boolean indicating whether the error should be ignored. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. status_code string, integer, callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) Optional. The exception status code. This value can be a string, integer, or a callable that takes in exception information (exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) returned from sys.exc_info() and returns the status code as an integer. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In a large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any parameters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.notice_error() Copy Example using boolean An example of notice_error using a boolean value. This indicates that an error should be expected. newrelic.agent.notice_error(expected=True) Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of notice_error using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.notice_error(attributes={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.notice_error(ignore=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored/expected, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored/ expected regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored/ expected. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this...

Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction.

For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying.

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this...

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to...

Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this...

Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ.

If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.notice_error(error=None, attributes={}, expected=None, ignore=None, status_code=None, application=None) Copy Records details of a Python exception as an error. Description By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use notice_error to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the currently handled exception will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When notice_error() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, notice_error will require no parameters. Parameter Description error tuple Optional and rarely used. A tuple containing exception information (exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) returned from sys.exc_info(). attributes dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. expected boolean, iterable [String] , callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback)->boolean Optional. Errors to mark as expected can be passed in as an iterable of strings in the form module:class. This value can also be a callable or a Boolean indicating whether the error is expected. These errors will be reported to the UI but will not affect Apdex score or error rate. ignore boolean, iterable [String] , callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback)->boolean Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in as an iterable of strings in the form module:class. This value can also be a callable or a Boolean indicating whether the error should be ignored. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. status_code string, integer, callable(exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) Optional. The exception status code. This value can be a string, integer, or a callable that takes in exception information (exception_class, exception_instance, traceback) returned from sys.exc_info() and returns the status code as an integer. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In a large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any parameters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.notice_error() Copy Example using boolean An example of notice_error using a boolean value. This indicates that an error should be expected. newrelic.agent.notice_error(expected=True) Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of notice_error using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.notice_error(attributes={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.notice_error(ignore=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored/expected, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored/ expected regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored/ expected. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this...

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to...

Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

The New Relic UI will show transactions initiated via RabbitMQ message receipt (subscribe/consume messages) as Message background tasks. Message creation via RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. Requirements Requires Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. Caution Message tasks are not started for consumers using TornadoConnection. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Pika client library allows Python applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9 or higher. The Python agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages produced by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"consumed\" messages APM conveniently groups and reports operations that interact with queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify bottlenecks and areas for performance improvement in your message passing architecture. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ basic_publish basic_get basic_consume (callback) View in New Relic UI Queue operations appear on APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction): The transaction’s Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message).

The Transaction trace summary page may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results.

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add Browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the Browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting Browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the Browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add Browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the Browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting Browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the Browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

The New Relic UI will show transactions initiated via RabbitMQ message receipt (subscribe/consume messages) as Message background tasks. Message creation via RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. Requirements Requires Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. Caution Message tasks are not started for consumers using TornadoConnection. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Pika client library allows Python applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9 or higher. The Python agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages produced by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"consumed\" messages APM conveniently groups and reports operations that interact with queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify bottlenecks and areas for performance improvement in your message passing architecture. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ basic_publish basic_get basic_consume (callback) View in New Relic UI Queue operations appear on APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction): The transaction’s Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message). Transaction traces also provide additional details for messages. Tip You can select transaction traces from the app's Summary or Transactions pages in APM. The Transaction trace summary page may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results. The Transaction trace page includes a dedicated Messages tab that shows a summary of the message activity that occurred as part of the transaction. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Messages tab lists the RabbitMQ message details.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add Browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the Browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting Browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the Browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

      "body": "The Python agent supports the Pika RabbitMQ client library, giving you visibility into the performance of your message processing, for both incoming and outgoing messages. The New Relic UI will show transactions initiated via RabbitMQ message receipt (subscribe/consume messages) as Message background tasks. Message creation via RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. Requirements Requires Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. Caution Message tasks are not started for consumers using TornadoConnection. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Pika client library allows Python applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9 or higher. The Python agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages produced by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"consumed\" messages APM conveniently groups and reports operations that interact with queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify bottlenecks and areas for performance improvement in your message passing architecture. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ basic_publish basic_get basic_consume (callback) View in New Relic UI Queue operations appear on APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction): The transaction’s Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message). Transaction traces also provide additional details for messages. Tip You can select transaction traces from the app's Summary or Transactions pages in APM. The Transaction trace summary page may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results. The Transaction trace page includes a dedicated Messages tab that shows a summary of the message activity that occurred as part of the transaction. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Messages tab lists the RabbitMQ message details.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add Browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the Browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting Browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the Browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true.

Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction.

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "This document details how to instrument third-party gems with the Ruby agent, as well as some best practices for interacting with the agent. This is useful if you are using a gem that the Ruby agent does not instrument by default, or if you are a gem author who wants to add instrumentation for your library. Contents Finding third-party extensions Anyone can write a gem that builds on top of the Ruby agent. New Relic maintains a repository called extends_newrelic_rpm to track these extensions and to provide links to other gems that build the Ruby agent. These extensions are not supported by New Relic. New Relic gathers these links as a service to our customers. Issues with those gems should be reported to the respective projects on GitHub. Extensions as gems New Relic encourages third-party extensions to be maintained as gems, with one gem per instrumented library. For example, newrelic-redis provides instrumentation for the redis gem. Starting transactions If your library provides code which should be represented as a full transaction in New Relic (for example: a web request or background job that isn't instrumented by the Ruby agent), then use one of these mechanisms for starting a transaction. add_transaction_tracer The simplest way to get a transaction started is to call add_transaction_tracer on the method. This assumes that NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation is included in your class. class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy perform_action_with_newrelic_trace Sometimes you need slightly more control over the transaction that New Relic generates. When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

This is useful if you are using a gem that the Ruby agent does not instrument by default, or if you are a gem author who wants to add instrumentation for your library. Contents Finding third-party extensions Anyone can write a gem that builds on top of the Ruby agent. New Relic maintains a repository called extends_newrelic_rpm to track these extensions and to provide links to other gems that build the Ruby agent. These extensions are not supported by New Relic. New Relic gathers these links as a service to our customers. Issues with those gems should be reported to the respective projects on GitHub. Extensions as gems New Relic encourages third-party extensions to be maintained as gems, with one gem per instrumented library. For example, newrelic-redis provides instrumentation for the redis gem.

To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files.

      "body": "This document details how to instrument third-party gems with the Ruby agent, as well as some best practices for interacting with the agent. This is useful if you are using a gem that the Ruby agent does not instrument by default, or if you are a gem author who wants to add instrumentation for your library. Contents Finding third-party extensions Anyone can write a gem that builds on top of the Ruby agent. New Relic maintains a repository called extends_newrelic_rpm to track these extensions and to provide links to other gems that build the Ruby agent. These extensions are not supported by New Relic. New Relic gathers these links as a service to our customers. Issues with those gems should be reported to the respective projects on GitHub. Extensions as gems New Relic encourages third-party extensions to be maintained as gems, with one gem per instrumented library. For example, newrelic-redis provides instrumentation for the redis gem. Starting transactions If your library provides code which should be represented as a full transaction in New Relic (for example: a web request or background job that isn't instrumented by the Ruby agent), then use one of these mechanisms for starting a transaction. add_transaction_tracer The simplest way to get a transaction started is to call add_transaction_tracer on the method. This assumes that NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation is included in your class. class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy perform_action_with_newrelic_trace Sometimes you need slightly more control over the transaction that New Relic generates. When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",

Starting transactions If your library provides code which should be represented as a full transaction in New Relic (for example: a web request or background job that isn't instrumented by the Ruby agent), then use one of these mechanisms for starting a transaction. add_transaction_tracer The simplest way to get a transaction started is to call add_transaction_tracer on the method. This assumes that NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation is included in your class. class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy perform_action_with_newrelic_trace Sometimes you need slightly more control over the transaction that New Relic generates. When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon (;). For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. entity_guid Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENTITY_GUID The Entity GUID for the entity running this agent. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED Deprecated. For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module.prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string <a href=\"https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#apdex_f\">apdex_f</a>. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when <a href=\"#transaction_tracer.explain_enabled\">explain_enabled</a> is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to New Relic per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The Browser monitorig page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from browser monitoring. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on span events. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_SEGMENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on transaction segments. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon (;). For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. entity_guid Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENTITY_GUID The Entity GUID for the entity running this agent. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED Deprecated. For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module.prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string <a href=\"https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#apdex_f\">apdex_f</a>. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when <a href=\"#transaction_tracer.explain_enabled\">explain_enabled</a> is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to New Relic per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The Browser monitorig page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Deprecated; use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from browser monitoring. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on span events. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_SEGMENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on transaction segments. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. These attribute settings apply to version 3.12.0 or higher of the Ruby agent. Ruby agent attributes The following table lists the attributes that can be automatically captured by the Ruby agent: httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The httpResponseCode attribute (string value) is deprecated as of agent version 6.12.0. http.statusCode (integer value) should be used instead. request.headers.referer The HTTP referrer header if present (minus the query string). Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable request.parameters.* The HTTP request parameters, associated with the transaction. Available for Rails, Sinatra, and Grape applications only. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Note: The capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable request parameters for transaction traces and traced errors. job.resque.args.* Job arguments passed to the Resque worker. Arguments passed to Resque workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.resque.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Resque job that takes two arguments will have keys job.resque.args.0 and job.resque.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The resque.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Resque arguments for transaction traces, traced errors. job.sidekiq.args.* Job arguments passed to the Sidekiq worker. Arguments passed to Sidekiq workers are positional. These arguments are stored as keys of the form job.sidekiq.args.<position> where position is the index of the argument to the perform method. For example, a Sidekiq job that takes two arguments will have keys job.sidekiq.args.0 and job.sidekiq.args.1. Defaults: Transaction traces: Disabled Error collector (traced errors): Disabled Transaction events: Disabled Page views (browser monitoring): Unavailable Note: The sidekiq.capture_params property is deprecated. However, if set to true, it will enable capture of Sidekiq arguments for transaction traces and traced errors. Adding custom attributes To capture additional custom attributes from your application, use NewRelic::Agent.add_custom_attributes. For full reference see Collecting custom attributes. Defaults: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Page views (browser monitoring): Disabled Caution If you want to query your custom parameters or attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms for naming them. Upgrading the Ruby agent When upgrading to Ruby agent 3.12.0 or higher, upgrade your newrelic.yml configuration.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon (;). For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. entity_guid Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENTITY_GUID The Entity GUID for the entity running this agent. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED Deprecated. For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances.

      "body": "With the Ruby agent, you can add New Relic Browser instrumentation to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable Browser in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the Browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Ruby agent. Requirements In order to use New Relic Browser with your Ruby agent, make sure you meet these requirements: New Relic Ruby agent (version 3.0.1 or higher) For automatic instrumentation: Rails 2.3 or higher For manual instrumentation: Rails 2.0 to 2.2 Use auto-instrumentation Automatic instrumentation works with Rack, and requires Rails 2.3 or higher. Configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with end user monitoring scripts, by adding or editing the following flag in newrelic.yml. browser_monitoring: auto_instrument: true Copy This is the simplest way to monitor end users. The Ruby agent examines each page from your application and automatically injects the Browser JavaScript in the header. Auto-instrumentation works for environments that support Rack. For performance reasons the agent scans only the first 50k of your application's response for the header instrumentation point. In cases where a X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present and the <head> tag is longer than 50k, auto-instrumentation will fail gracefully. Auto-instrumentation will look for an X-UA-Compatible meta tag and insert the JavaScript directly after it. If the auto-instrumentation cannot find an X-UA-Compatible meta tag, it will insert after the opening head tag, and failing that it will insert after the opening body tag. If any of these tags are wrapped in conditionals or comments, the automatic instrumentation will likely fail. If auto-instrumentation fails to correctly instrument your application’s pages, then you must manually instrument via agent API. Manually instrument via agent API If you are using Rails 2.1 to 2.2 or cannot use auto-instrumentation, you can still set up end user monitoring manually by including appropriate scripts in your pages. Use the New Relic Ruby agent's API to generate the script to be inserted into your pages. For example, to modify your application's template to call the agent, use: <head> <%= ::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header rescue \"\" %> ... existing template code ... </head> Copy CSP Nonce support CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 7.1.0+ of the Ruby agent. To use a nonce with the Browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API. You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation. For example, NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_header(nonce). Troubleshooting If you do not see any browser data being reported, view the HTML source and confirm two blocks of script similar to this in your HTML head: <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.NREUM||(NREUM={});...</script> Copy If these are not present, check the auto-instrumentation settings or the placement of manual instrumentation in your template files. In versions of the Ruby agent prior to 3.7.0, <%=::NewRelic::Agent.browser_timing_footer rescue \"\" %> also needed to be called as close to the bottom of the document as possible. With 3.7.0, all the required script is included by browser_timing_header. browser_timing_footer returns an empty string for compatibility. Disable auto-instrumentation The default value of auto-instrument is true (even when unspecified). To disable auto-instrumentation, set this flag to false. To disable auto-instrumentation only for certain controllers or controller actions, use newrelic_ignore_enduser. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected by this call.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",
