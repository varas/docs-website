      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon.

      "body": "Use the Hosts page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list.

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

      "body": "Use the Hosts page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (e.g. newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz) maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is logged. Once an error has been logged, the cached debug messages are logged, but only the most recent number of configured debug messages. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, after an error is logged, only the 10 most recent debug messages are logged, and older logs are discarded. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

      "body": "Problem The New Relic infrastructure agent is consuming too much CPU. Solution The New Relic infrastructure agent is designed to report a broad range of system data with minimal CPU and memory consumption. However, if you have a need to reduce your CPU consumption, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency of various samplers and plugins. This topic highlights some newrelic-infra.yml configurations that may reduce your CPU usage: Reduce event sampling Reduce agent plugin reporting Review on-host integrations Reduce event sampling The infrastructure agent reports several default events at specific frequencies. To lower the overhead, you can reduce the sampling frequency in seconds, or you can completely disable the samplers by setting the corresponding property value to -1. Important We don't recommend a sample rate larger than 60 seconds because you may see gaps in the New Relic user interface charts. The table below lists some samplers to configure: Event Sampling frequency Allow/deny list Network Network sampling rate Not available Process Process sampling rate Allow list (Windows only) Storage Storage sampling rate Deny list System System sampling rate Not available Reduce agent plugin reporting The infrastructure agent has built-in plugins that collect inventory data (specific system configuration and state information). For some systems, the CPU consumption may be relatively high if the plugins are gathering a lot of data. To reduce the footprint, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency for specific plugins that report data you don’t want. How to enable and disable plugins Disable a single plugin: To disable a plugin, set the corresponding property value to -1. Disable all plugins: disable_all_plugins: true Enable selected plugins: To enable certain plugins, insert an exception in disable_all_plugins. For example, the following configuration disables all plugins, but the Network Interfaces plugin reports every 120 seconds: disable_all_plugins: true network_interface_interval_sec: 120 Copy Disable SELinux semodule -l (Linux only) The SELinux plugin periodically invokes the semodule -l system command to get information about the existing SELinux modules. In most CentOS/RedHat distributions, this command will generate CPU consumption peaks. To disable this functionality, insert the following configuration option in your /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file: selinux_enable_semodule: false Reduce or disable Sysctl (Linux only) The Sysctl plugin walks the whole /sys directory structure and reads values from all the files there. Disabling it or reducing the interval may decrease some CPU System time in the Infrastructure agent. You can disable inventory frequency by setting it to a negative number or reduce the frequeny by setting the sysctl_interval_sec configuration value to the number of seconds between consecutive executions of the plugin. For example, to execute the plugin once every 10 minutes: sysctl_interval_sec: 600 Copy To disable the Sysctl plugin: sysctl_interval_sec: -1 Copy The current default value for the sysctl_interval_sec property is 60. Additional plugins to reduce or disable The following inventory plugins are not especially CPU consuming, but you can still reduce their frequency or disable them by setting the corresponding configuration options. Linux plugins For configuration of these Linux plugins, see Plugin variables: Cloud Security Groups Daemon Tools DPKG Facter Kernel Modules Network interfaces RPM SELinux Supervisord Sysctl Systemd SysV Upstart Users SSHD configuration Windows plugins For configuration of these Windows plugins, see Plugin variables: Network interfaces Windows services Windows updates Review on-host integrations If you use infrastructure on-host integrations, this may have additional impacts on CPU usage. The nature of the impact and the methods to adjust the impact depend on the integration you're using.

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in Infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-Infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see New Relic APM data in Infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "Problem The New Relic infrastructure agent is consuming too much CPU. Solution The New Relic infrastructure agent is designed to report a broad range of system data with minimal CPU and memory consumption. However, if you have a need to reduce your CPU consumption, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency of various samplers and plugins. This topic highlights some newrelic-infra.yml configurations that may reduce your CPU usage: Reduce event sampling Reduce agent plugin reporting Review on-host integrations Reduce event sampling The infrastructure agent reports several default events at specific frequencies. To lower the overhead, you can reduce the sampling frequency in seconds, or you can completely disable the samplers by setting the corresponding property value to -1. Important We don't recommend a sample rate larger than 60 seconds because you may see gaps in the New Relic user interface charts. The table below lists some samplers to configure: Event Sampling frequency Allow/deny list Network Network sampling rate Not available Process Process sampling rate Allow list (Windows only) Storage Storage sampling rate Deny list System System sampling rate Not available Reduce agent plugin reporting The infrastructure agent has built-in plugins that collect inventory data (specific system configuration and state information). For some systems, the CPU consumption may be relatively high if the plugins are gathering a lot of data. To reduce the footprint, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency for specific plugins that report data you don’t want. How to enable and disable plugins Disable a single plugin: To disable a plugin, set the corresponding property value to -1. Disable all plugins: disable_all_plugins: true Enable selected plugins: To enable certain plugins, insert an exception in disable_all_plugins. For example, the following configuration disables all plugins, but the Network Interfaces plugin reports every 120 seconds: disable_all_plugins: true network_interface_interval_sec: 120 Copy Disable SELinux semodule -l (Linux only) The SELinux plugin periodically invokes the semodule -l system command to get information about the existing SELinux modules. In most CentOS/RedHat distributions, this command will generate CPU consumption peaks. To disable this functionality, insert the following configuration option in your /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file: selinux_enable_semodule: false Reduce or disable Sysctl (Linux only) The Sysctl plugin walks the whole /sys directory structure and reads values from all the files there. Disabling it or reducing the interval may decrease some CPU System time in the Infrastructure agent. You can disable inventory frequency by setting it to a negative number or reduce the frequeny by setting the sysctl_interval_sec configuration value to the number of seconds between consecutive executions of the plugin. For example, to execute the plugin once every 10 minutes: sysctl_interval_sec: 600 Copy To disable the Sysctl plugin: sysctl_interval_sec: -1 Copy The current default value for the sysctl_interval_sec property is 60. Additional plugins to reduce or disable The following inventory plugins are not especially CPU consuming, but you can still reduce their frequency or disable them by setting the corresponding configuration options. Linux plugins For configuration of these Linux plugins, see Plugin variables: Cloud Security Groups Daemon Tools DPKG Facter Kernel Modules Network interfaces RPM SELinux Supervisord Sysctl Systemd SysV Upstart Users SSHD configuration Windows plugins For configuration of these Windows plugins, see Plugin variables: Network interfaces Windows services Windows updates Review on-host integrations If you use infrastructure on-host integrations, this may have additional impacts on CPU usage. The nature of the impact and the methods to adjust the impact depend on the integration you're using. Here are some ways to adjust on-host integration CPU usage: See if your integration has configuration options you can adjust. If possible, spread out the monitoring load by adding additional infrastructure agents. For example, the Kafka integration allows a multi-agent deployment.",

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Problem You installed the New Relic infrastructure agent and waited a few minutes, but no data appears in the Infrastructure UI. Solution Data should appear in the Infrastructure monitoring UI within a few minutes for accounts with previously installed agents. Important For accounts installing the infrastructure agent for the first time, the latency for data appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI can be tens of minutes. If the following steps verify the installation and no obvious error conditions appear in the verbose logs, monitor the Infrastructure UI for a longer period before contacting support.newrelic.com for assistance. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Missing infrastructure data If no data appears in the UI, try the following steps to diagnose the problem: Use your package manager to verify that the infrastructure agent is installed: Verify install for apt (Debian or Ubuntu) Use dpkg to verify that the agent is installed: dpkg -l | grep newrelic-infra Copy If dpkg returns no output, see Install with apt. Verify install for yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) Use rpm to verify that agent is installed: rpm -qa | grep newrelic-infra Copy If rpm returns no output, see Install with yum. Verify install for Windows Server Use the Windows command prompt or Powershell to verify that the agent directory exists: dir \"C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\" Copy If you receive a File not found error, see Install for Windows Server. Use your init system to verify that the agent is running: Verify status with SystemD Use SystemD commands with CentOS 7, Debian 8, RHEL 7, and Ubuntu 15.04 or higher: Check that the agent is running: sudo systemctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo systemctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with System V Use System V commands with Debian 7: Check that the agent is running: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra status Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo /etc/init.d/newrelic-infra start Copy Verify status with Upstart Use Upstart commands with Amazon Linux, CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Ubuntu 14.10 or lower: Check that the agent is running: sudo initctl status newrelic-infra Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually: sudo initctl start newrelic-infra Copy Verify status with Windows Use the Windows command prompt: Check that the agent is running: sc query \"newrelic-infra\" | find \"RUNNING\" Copy If the agent isn't running, start the agent manually with the Windows command prompt: net start newrelic-infra Copy If running net start newrelic-infra returns The service name is invalid, the Infrastructure agent may not have been installed correctly and the service was not properly created. To test this: From Powershell, run the command get-service newrelic-infra, which will return the status of the service. If it returns an error Cannot find any service with service name newrelic-infra, then follow standard procedures to reinstall the agent. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Verify that your newrelic-infra.yml configuration file contains a valid license_key setting. Verify that the host has a unique hostname, and verify that the hostname is not localhost. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post. Verify that no firewalls or proxies are blocking outbound connections from the agent process to the Infrastructure domains and ports. Confirm the host is reporting correctly even though it is not appearing in the Infrastructure monitoring UI by creating a basic query in Insights, like: SELECT * FROM SystemSample SINCE 60 minutes ago LIMIT 100 Copy Use the query results to note the timestamps, which show when the data was reported. To determine when data was first received, look at the earliest timestamp. Generate verbose logs and examine the logs for errors.

      "body": "Problem The New Relic infrastructure agent is consuming too much CPU. Solution The New Relic infrastructure agent is designed to report a broad range of system data with minimal CPU and memory consumption. However, if you have a need to reduce your CPU consumption, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency of various samplers and plugins. This topic highlights some newrelic-infra.yml configurations that may reduce your CPU usage: Reduce event sampling Reduce agent plugin reporting Review on-host integrations Reduce event sampling The infrastructure agent reports several default events at specific frequencies. To lower the overhead, you can reduce the sampling frequency in seconds, or you can completely disable the samplers by setting the corresponding property value to -1. Important We don't recommend a sample rate larger than 60 seconds because you may see gaps in the New Relic user interface charts. The table below lists some samplers to configure: Event Sampling frequency Allow/deny list Network Network sampling rate Not available Process Process sampling rate Allow list (Windows only) Storage Storage sampling rate Deny list System System sampling rate Not available Reduce agent plugin reporting The infrastructure agent has built-in plugins that collect inventory data (specific system configuration and state information). For some systems, the CPU consumption may be relatively high if the plugins are gathering a lot of data. To reduce the footprint, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency for specific plugins that report data you don’t want. How to enable and disable plugins Disable a single plugin: To disable a plugin, set the corresponding property value to -1. Disable all plugins: disable_all_plugins: true Enable selected plugins: To enable certain plugins, insert an exception in disable_all_plugins. For example, the following configuration disables all plugins, but the Network Interfaces plugin reports every 120 seconds: disable_all_plugins: true network_interface_interval_sec: 120 Copy Disable SELinux semodule -l (Linux only) The SELinux plugin periodically invokes the semodule -l system command to get information about the existing SELinux modules. In most CentOS/RedHat distributions, this command will generate CPU consumption peaks. To disable this functionality, insert the following configuration option in your /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file: selinux_enable_semodule: false Reduce or disable Sysctl (Linux only) The Sysctl plugin walks the whole /sys directory structure and reads values from all the files there. Disabling it or reducing the interval may decrease some CPU System time in the Infrastructure agent. You can disable inventory frequency by setting it to a negative number or reduce the frequeny by setting the sysctl_interval_sec configuration value to the number of seconds between consecutive executions of the plugin. For example, to execute the plugin once every 10 minutes: sysctl_interval_sec: 600 Copy To disable the Sysctl plugin: sysctl_interval_sec: -1 Copy The current default value for the sysctl_interval_sec property is 60. Additional plugins to reduce or disable The following inventory plugins are not especially CPU consuming, but you can still reduce their frequency or disable them by setting the corresponding configuration options. Linux plugins For configuration of these Linux plugins, see Plugin variables: Cloud Security Groups Daemon Tools DPKG Facter Kernel Modules Network interfaces RPM SELinux Supervisord Sysctl Systemd SysV Upstart Users SSHD configuration Windows plugins For configuration of these Windows plugins, see Plugin variables: Network interfaces Windows services Windows updates Review on-host integrations If you use infrastructure on-host integrations, this may have additional impacts on CPU usage. The nature of the impact and the methods to adjust the impact depend on the integration you're using. Here are some ways to adjust on-host integration CPU usage: See if your integration has configuration options you can adjust. If possible, spread out the monitoring load by adding additional infrastructure agents. For example, the Kafka integration allows a multi-agent deployment.",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in Infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-Infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see New Relic APM data in Infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API allows you to create and manage dashboards. Important Note that this API will be permanently deprecated between July 28 - August 30, 2021. Firstly, on July 28 the list and show endpoints and then on August 30 the rest of endpoints. We have a migration guide to help you transition to using the new dashboards API. For instructions on using the UI, see Dashboards. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. For detailed examples and use cases, see this New Relic blog post. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Average daily page views The average daily page views for that account or application. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Browser-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

Available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls. Data generation Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every event namespace. A NrDailyUsage event includes a count of the events under that namespace. To view the attributes for this event, see the NrDailyUsage entry in the data dictionary. Usage calculations Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Insights usage page, set the time picker to Current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. The Insights usage UI only displays paid events: these are events that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. It does not display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also query the product included events. How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's data retention period. For a list of the applicable event types, see Event namespaces.

Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs. For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see Introduction to usage data. Tip Insights writes usage events once per day. That is why these queries use since 24 hours ago or timeseries 1 day. Here are some NRQL query examples about usage. Stored event usage for last month This query will tell you the \"billable\" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events. SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) AS 'Paid events' FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Current Insights usage for an account This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by event namespace. Be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in these queries with your account ID. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsEventNamespace Copy This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces: SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Copy Current Insights usage for multiple accounts This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by event namespace.

      "body": "In order to monitor any application on Linux using a language that can import C libraries, you must: Create a config using newrelic_new_app_config(), connect to the daemon using newrelic_init(), and connect your application using newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing plan require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing plan have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI To set high security in the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. If you are on our original pricing plan, only the account owner can view this option. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic's custom instrumentation editor allows Java app users to implement custom instrumentation via the New Relic user interface. The editor is the preferred choice when you cannot modify your application code and don't have that many methods to instrument. See Java custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options and the reasons for using each. To use the custom instrumentation editor: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Java app) > Settings > Instrumentation. Use the custom instrumentation editor to: Instrument an unsupported framework. Gain additional insight into uninstrumented methods. Ignore particular transactions. Requirements To use the custom instrumentation editor, you must meet the following requirements: Requirement Comments Agent Java agent version 3.17.0 or higher Security Users of high security mode must export their instrumentation and manually import it to their app server. Define custom instrumentation To define custom instrumentation from the New Relic user interface, use a thread profiling session to collect detailed stack traces of each thread in your application. If possible, test your custom instrumentation in a pre-production environment before changing the instrumentation rules in your production app. In either environment, use the custom instrumentation editor to define the methods you want instrumented, and apply your changes: Create a new thread profiler session. To ensure you collect sufficient data, set the length of the session to at least two minutes. Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. Scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the Recently collected thread profiles list, then select the most recent thread profile. Expand individual methods to locate uninstrumented methods. To define instrumentation rules for particular nodes, select Instrument or Ignore, and customize the rules if necessary. To save your settings, select Confirm instrumentation changes. Deploy your changes from the Instrumentation page: To deploy your changes automatically, select Deploy instrumentation changes. To deploy your changes manually, select Export XML, and see exporting your instrumentation. Caution Avoid over-instrumenting whenever possible. With each additional method that is instrumented, the agent will be using more resources and your application will incur more overhead. In addition, deploying your instrumentation will cause a brief period of higher overhead. This can noticeably slow application requests for several seconds. If you applied your changes from the UI, the agent will begin instrumenting your methods within a few harvest cycles (typically a few minutes). Manual instrumentation using the editor You can also create instrumentation points directly in the editor without using a thread profile: From the custom instrumentation editor, select Add manual instrumentation to manually enter a class and method to be instrumented or ignored. Follow the custom instrumentation by XML rules when defining your instrumentation points. Deploy your changes from the instrumentation editor. Using this method to add instrumentation exposes additional functionality beyond what is available from a thread profile. In addition to matching methods by signature, you can also instrument methods by return type, methods on interfaces, and by Java annotation. These more complex instrumentation types can be created and deleted in the editor, but not edited. Important If a method is marked Instrumentation not allowed, follow New Relic's troubleshooting procedures for custom instrumentation. Deploy changes manually You can also use the custom instrumentation editor to build a custom instrumentation set, then export an instrumentation file and manually import it to your app server. This is required for users of high security mode. To export your instrumentation, define custom instrumentation via the UI. Then select Export xml from the Instrumentation page, and import the file on your app server. Page functions The Instrumentation page supports the following features: If you want to... Do this... Pause or disable custom instrumentation Select Disable instrumentation to temporarily disable all UI-defined custom instrumentation. Select Enable instrumentation to re-enable your instrumentation settings. Import existing instrumentation You can import an existing custom instrumentation xml file by selecting Import xml. You can also Export xml if you do not want to deploy your changes automatically. Edit or delete instrumentation points You cannot edit manual instrumentation, only delete it. Select Remove to stop instrumenting a particular method. Select Edit to change the instrumentation rules. View instrumentation history You can view each previous iteration of your custom instrumentation from the Instrumentation history tab, including who deployed changes and when. You can restore an old version by selecting export to download a copy of the custom instrumentation file, then importing it to the instrumentation editor. Instrumentation options You can define the following options with the custom instrumentation editor: Instrumentation options Comments Instrument methods Begin instrumenting the selected method. Instrumented methods will be visible in the New Relic UI. Instrument supports the following child options: Name the transaction (transaction name): Override the standard transaction name, defined by the automatic naming rules. The UI will instead use the listed name. Start the transaction when this method executes: Rather than including metrics from this metric inside its parent transaction, create a new transaction for this method. Agent behavior with this option depends on whether there is a pre-existing transaction on the thread. Report custom attributes Method parameters can be captured as attributes on a transaction. New Relic reports these attributes to transaction traces, traced errors, and New Relic One Transaction events. For security reasons, capturing custom attributes using the Custom Instrumentation Editor is disabled by default and cannot be enabled while you are using high security mode. If you want to report custom attributes using the custom instrumentation editor and you do not want the Java agent to be in High security mode, disable High security mode and then add the following text in the common: block of your newrelic.yml: reinstrument: attributes_enabled: true Copy Ignore transactions Ignore this method entirely. The agent will not report metrics from this method, and the method will not contribute to Apdex calculations. Results with \"start\" option If you select Instrument methods > Start the transaction when this method executes, agent behavior depends on whether there is a pre-existing transaction on the thread. When the class or method is instrumented: Is the \"Start the transaction\" flag checked? Yes No If a pre-existing transaction is on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is checked: The agent ignores the Start the transaction flag. The agent includes the class/method into the pre-existing transaction. If a pre-existing transaction is on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is not checked, the agent includes the class/method into the pre-existing transaction. If a transaction is not on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is checked: The agent discovers there is no current transaction. The agent creates a new transaction starting with the class/method you have instrumented. If a transaction is not on that thread and the Start the transaction flag is not checked: The agent looks for a transaction on that thread and does not find one. The metric is dropped.",

      "body": "APM for Java will typically produce useful performance data automatically. However, if New Relic does not support your framework, or if you want to set up additional monitoring, you will want to implement custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that aren't captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation, and lets you add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects metrics and events from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework or component, you may see some transaction information out of the box, and custom instrumentation can be used to supplement the information the Agent reports by default. Important If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transactions, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. When to choose custom instrumentation Choose custom instrumentation in these situations: New Relic does not support your framework and transactions do not appear in the UI You would like to add detail to your transaction traces Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without sufficient detail Implement custom instrumentation You can implement custom instrumentation with one of these methods: Method Description The New Relic UI New Relic for Java includes an option in the UI for custom instrumentation called the Custom Instrumentation Editor. This option doesn't require any direct modification of your application code, so is a good choice if you don't want to or can't modify your code. The editor is, however, fairly limited in functionality compared to the Java agent API. API annotation Using the New Relic Java agent API, you can annotate the methods in your application code that you want to monitor. The annotation method is robust and easy to troubleshoot. If you are willing to modify your source code, annotation is the recommended method. If you have many methods you want to instrument, you might prefer XML instrumentation. For more about the API and its other functions, see Intro to the Java agent API. XML If you can't modify your code, or if you need to instrument many methods, XML instrumentation is the best custom instrumentation method. With this method, you specify the classes you want to instrument in an external XML file. While XML instrumentation is powerful, it is also more difficult to use than the other instrumentation methods. For simpler instrumentation needs, New Relic recommends annotation or instrumentation via the UI. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. You can also monitor Java Management Extensions (JMX) via custom instrumentation. JMX is a way to monitor and manage applications, devices, and services. You can implement JMX monitoring via an external YAML file.",

With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported. Features Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. New Relic's Elasticsearch monitoring integration allows you to track cluster status, CPU utilization, read/write latency, throughput, and other metrics, at specific points in time. Elasticsearch data is also available to query, analyze, and chart your data. Activate integration To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon Elasticsearch integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute View and use data To view and use this integration's data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the Elasticsearch integration links. To query and explore your data, use the DatastoreSample event type with the appropriate provider value: ElasticsearchCluster for clusters ElasticsearchNode for nodes Metric data The Elasticsearch integration collects these metrics for clusters: Name Relevant statistics Description ClusterStatus.green Minimum, Maximum Indicates that all index shards are allocated to nodes in the cluster. ClusterStatus.yellow Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary shards for all indices are allocated to nodes in a cluster, but the replica shards for at least one index are not. Single node clusters always initialize with this cluster status because there is no second node to which a replica can be assigned. You can either increase your node count to obtain a green cluster status, or you can use the Amazon ES API to set the number_of_replicas setting for your index to 0. For more information, see Amazon's documentation for Updating indices settings. ClusterStatus.red Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary and replica shards of at least one index are not allocated to nodes in a cluster. For more information, see Amazon's documentation on Red Cluster Status. Nodes Minimum, Maximum, Average The number of nodes in the Amazon ES cluster. SearchableDocuments Minimum, Maximum, Average The total number of searchable documents across all indices in the cluster. DeletedDocuments Minimum, Maximum, Average The total number of deleted documents across all indices in the cluster. CPUUtilization Minimum, Maximum, Average The maximum percentage of CPU resources used for data nodes in the cluster. FreeStorageSpace Minimum The free space, in megabytes, for all data nodes in the cluster. ClusterUsedSpace Minimum, Maximum The total used space, in megabytes, for a cluster.

A value of 1 means that it is blocking requests. JVMMemoryPressure Maximum The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all data nodes in the cluster. AutomatedSnapshotFailure Minimum, Maximum The number of failed automated snapshots for the cluster. A value of 1 indicates that no automated snapshot was taken for the domain in the previous 36 hours. CPUCreditBalance Minimum The remaining CPU credits available for data nodes in the cluster. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute. This metrics is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. KibanaHealthyNodes Minimum A health check for Kibana. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that Kibana is inaccessible. In most cases, the health of Kibana mirrors the health of the cluster. KMSKeyError Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled. To restore the domain to normal operations, re-enable the key. KMSKeyInaccessible Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to Amazon ES. You can't recover domains that are in this state. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain. InvalidHostHeaderRequests Sum The number of HTTP requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster that included an invalid (or missing) host header. ElasticsearchRequests Sum The number of requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster. RequestCount Sum The number of requests to a domain and the HTTP response code (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for each request. MasterCPUUtilization Average The maximum percentage of CPU resources used by the dedicated master nodes. We recommend increasing the size of the instance type when this metric reaches 60 percent. MasterJVMMemoryPressure Maximum The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all dedicated master nodes in the cluster.

This metric is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. MasterReachableFromNode Minimum A health check for MasterNotDiscovered exceptions. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that /_cluster/health/ is failing. Failures mean that the master node stopped or is not reachable. They are usually the result of a network connectivity issue or AWS dependency problem. ReadLatency Minimum, Maximum, Average The latency, in seconds, for read operations on EBS volumes. WriteLatency Minimum, Maximum, Average The latency, in seconds, for write operations on EBS volumes. ReadThroughput Minimum, Maximum, Average The throughput, in bytes per second, for read operations on EBS volumes. WriteThroughput Minimum, Maximum, Average The throughput, in bytes per second, for write operations on EBS volumes.

JVMGCYoungCollectionTime For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the cluster has spent performing \"young generation\" garbage collection. JVMGCOldCollectionCount For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The number of times that \"old generation\" garbage collection has run. In a cluster with sufficient resources, this number should remain small and grow infrequently. JVMGCOldCollectionTime For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the cluster has spent performing \"old generation\" garbage collection. ThreadpoolForce_mergeQueue For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The number of queued tasks in the force merge thread pool.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the AWS Health integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Explore integration data To use this integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select any of the available AWS Health integration links. To view a complete list of open issues, select the Inventory page. To view a timeline when an AWS Health inventory event is created, modified, or deleted, use the Events page. Events monitoring and alerts AWS Health events are ingested in New Relic One as AwsHealthNotification events. You can query, create widgets, and define NRQL alert policies based on these events. The following table shows the main attributes available for AwsHealthNotification events: Event Attribute Description affectedEntityArn The AWS resource ARN. arn The ARN of the AWS Health event itself. affectedRegion The AWS affected region. affectedResources Number of affected resources. Auto-generated metric that can be used to define New Relic alert conditions. description Detailed description of the event. eventTypeCategory AWS Health category: Issue, ScheduledChange, AccountNotification, Investigation. eventTypeCode A list of unique identifiers for event types. For example,AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT or AWS_RDS_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED. service The AWS services associated with the event. For example, EC2, RDS. statusCode The AWS health event status: Open, Closed, Upcoming. startTime Date and time the event began. NRQL alert conditions can be defined to receive notifications when health events are reported by AWS. For example, the following query monitors any open issues on EC2 by resource: SELECT uniqueCount(affectedEntityArn) FROM AwsHealthNotification where statusCode = 'open' and eventTypeCategory = 'Issue' and service = 'EC2' Copy Inventory data Inventory data provides information about active AWS Health events. New Relic's AWS Health integration generates three types of entities, each of which have the same inventory data: aws/health/issue/ aws/health/scheduled-change/ aws/health/notification/ Name Description affectedAvailabilityZone The AWS Availability Zone of the event. affectedEntities The ARNs of the entities that are affected by the event. Entities can refer to individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the AWS service. affectedRegion The AWS region of the affected entities. arn The unique identifier for the event. awsRegion The Personal Health Dashboard region. description The most recent description of the event. endTime The date and time that the event ended. eventTypeCategory The category of the event type. Possible values are issue, scheduledChange, or accountNotification. eventTypeCode The unique identifier for the event type. service The AWS service that is affected by the event. startTime The date and time that the event began. statusCode The most recent status of the event.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Typically, these errors happen anywhere outside of the GraphQL execution. For example, this could be an incorrect JSON payload or an incorrect query in the request, when the service is throttled, or even a potential misconfiguration on the Auth settings. 5XXError Count Errors encountered during the execution of a GraphQL query. For example, this could occur when a query request is initiated for an empty or incorrect schema, if the Amazon Cognito user pool ID or AWS Region is invalid. Alternatively, this could also happen if AWS AppSync encounters an issue during an execution of a request. Latency Milliseconds The time between when AWS AppSync receives a request from a client and when it returns a response to the client. This doesn't include the network latency encountered for a response to reach the end devices.",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations.

How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting Amazon Elasticsearch data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported. Features Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. New Relic's Elasticsearch monitoring integration allows you to track cluster status, CPU utilization, read/write latency, throughput, and other metrics, at specific points in time. Elasticsearch data is also available to query, analyze, and chart your data. Activate integration To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon Elasticsearch integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute View and use data To view and use this integration's data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the Elasticsearch integration links. To query and explore your data, use the DatastoreSample event type with the appropriate provider value: ElasticsearchCluster for clusters ElasticsearchNode for nodes Metric data The Elasticsearch integration collects these metrics for clusters: Name Relevant statistics Description ClusterStatus.green Minimum, Maximum Indicates that all index shards are allocated to nodes in the cluster. ClusterStatus.yellow Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary shards for all indices are allocated to nodes in a cluster, but the replica shards for at least one index are not. Single node clusters always initialize with this cluster status because there is no second node to which a replica can be assigned. You can either increase your node count to obtain a green cluster status, or you can use the Amazon ES API to set the number_of_replicas setting for your index to 0. For more information, see Amazon's documentation for Updating indices settings. ClusterStatus.red Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary and replica shards of at least one index are not allocated to nodes in a cluster. For more information, see Amazon's documentation on Red Cluster Status. Nodes Minimum, Maximum, Average The number of nodes in the Amazon ES cluster. SearchableDocuments Minimum, Maximum, Average The total number of searchable documents across all indices in the cluster. DeletedDocuments Minimum, Maximum, Average The total number of deleted documents across all indices in the cluster. CPUUtilization Minimum, Maximum, Average The maximum percentage of CPU resources used for data nodes in the cluster. FreeStorageSpace Minimum The free space, in megabytes, for all data nodes in the cluster. ClusterUsedSpace Minimum, Maximum The total used space, in megabytes, for a cluster. ClusterIndexWritesBlocked Maximum Indicates whether your cluster is accepting or blocking incoming write requests. A value of 0 means that the cluster is accepting requests. A value of 1 means that it is blocking requests. JVMMemoryPressure Maximum The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all data nodes in the cluster. AutomatedSnapshotFailure Minimum, Maximum The number of failed automated snapshots for the cluster. A value of 1 indicates that no automated snapshot was taken for the domain in the previous 36 hours. CPUCreditBalance Minimum The remaining CPU credits available for data nodes in the cluster. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute. This metrics is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. KibanaHealthyNodes Minimum A health check for Kibana. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that Kibana is inaccessible. In most cases, the health of Kibana mirrors the health of the cluster. KMSKeyError Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled. To restore the domain to normal operations, re-enable the key. KMSKeyInaccessible Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to Amazon ES. You can't recover domains that are in this state. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain. InvalidHostHeaderRequests Sum The number of HTTP requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster that included an invalid (or missing) host header. ElasticsearchRequests Sum The number of requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster. RequestCount Sum The number of requests to a domain and the HTTP response code (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for each request. MasterCPUUtilization Average The maximum percentage of CPU resources used by the dedicated master nodes. We recommend increasing the size of the instance type when this metric reaches 60 percent. MasterJVMMemoryPressure Maximum The maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all dedicated master nodes in the cluster. We recommend moving to a larger instance type when this metric reaches 85 percent. MasterCPUCreditBalance Minimum The remaining CPU credits available for dedicated master nodes in the cluster.

This metric is available only for the t2.micro.elasticsearch, t2.small.elasticsearch, and t2.medium.elasticsearch instance types. MasterReachableFromNode Minimum A health check for MasterNotDiscovered exceptions. A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that /_cluster/health/ is failing. Failures mean that the master node stopped or is not reachable. They are usually the result of a network connectivity issue or AWS dependency problem. ReadLatency Minimum, Maximum, Average The latency, in seconds, for read operations on EBS volumes. WriteLatency Minimum, Maximum, Average The latency, in seconds, for write operations on EBS volumes. ReadThroughput Minimum, Maximum, Average The throughput, in bytes per second, for read operations on EBS volumes. WriteThroughput Minimum, Maximum, Average The throughput, in bytes per second, for write operations on EBS volumes. DiskQueueDepth Minimum, Maximum, Average The number of pending input and output (I/O) requests for an EBS volume. ReadIOPS Minimum, Maximum, Average The number of input and output (I/O) operations per second for read operations on EBS volumes.

JVMGCYoungCollectionCount For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The number of times that \"young generation\" garbage collection has run. A large, ever-growing number of runs is a normal part of cluster operations. JVMGCYoungCollectionTime For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the cluster has spent performing \"young generation\" garbage collection. JVMGCOldCollectionCount For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The number of times that \"old generation\" garbage collection has run. In a cluster with sufficient resources, this number should remain small and grow infrequently. JVMGCOldCollectionTime For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the cluster has spent performing \"old generation\" garbage collection. ThreadpoolForce_mergeQueue For nodes: Maximum For clusters: Sum, Maximum, Average The number of queued tasks in the force merge thread pool.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

For example, this could be an incorrect JSON payload or an incorrect query in the request, when the service is throttled, or even a potential misconfiguration on the Auth settings. 5XXError Count Errors encountered during the execution of a GraphQL query. For example, this could occur when a query request is initiated for an empty or incorrect schema, if the Amazon Cognito user pool ID or AWS Region is invalid. Alternatively, this could also happen if AWS AppSync encounters an issue during an execution of a request. Latency Milliseconds The time between when AWS AppSync receives a request from a client and when it returns a response to the client. This doesn't include the network latency encountered for a response to reach the end devices.",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your AWS Health data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported. Features This integration collects information from AWS Health about events that can affect the AWS resources and services globally or in a specific account. This data can help you anticipate potential application outages. AWS Health reports three types of events: Open issues: Shows issues that might affect your AWS infrastructure. Scheduled changes: Informs you in advance of scheduled activities that might have an impact on AWS services and resources. Notifications: Provides additional information. Requirements This integration is available only for AWS customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan, because this is a requirement for using the AWS Health API. Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the AWS Health integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Explore integration data To use this integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select any of the available AWS Health integration links. To view a complete list of open issues, select the Inventory page. To view a timeline when an AWS Health inventory event is created, modified, or deleted, use the Events page. Events monitoring and alerts AWS Health events are ingested in New Relic One as AwsHealthNotification events. You can query, create widgets, and define NRQL alert policies based on these events. The following table shows the main attributes available for AwsHealthNotification events: Event Attribute Description affectedEntityArn The AWS resource ARN. arn The ARN of the AWS Health event itself. affectedRegion The AWS affected region. affectedResources Number of affected resources. Auto-generated metric that can be used to define New Relic alert conditions. description Detailed description of the event. eventTypeCategory AWS Health category: Issue, ScheduledChange, AccountNotification, Investigation. eventTypeCode A list of unique identifiers for event types. For example,AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT or AWS_RDS_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULED. service The AWS services associated with the event. For example, EC2, RDS. statusCode The AWS health event status: Open, Closed, Upcoming. startTime Date and time the event began. NRQL alert conditions can be defined to receive notifications when health events are reported by AWS. For example, the following query monitors any open issues on EC2 by resource: SELECT uniqueCount(affectedEntityArn) FROM AwsHealthNotification where statusCode = 'open' and eventTypeCategory = 'Issue' and service = 'EC2' Copy Inventory data Inventory data provides information about active AWS Health events. New Relic's AWS Health integration generates three types of entities, each of which have the same inventory data: aws/health/issue/ aws/health/scheduled-change/ aws/health/notification/ Name Description affectedAvailabilityZone The AWS Availability Zone of the event. affectedEntities The ARNs of the entities that are affected by the event. Entities can refer to individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any other construct, depending on the AWS service. affectedRegion The AWS region of the affected entities. arn The unique identifier for the event. awsRegion The Personal Health Dashboard region. description The most recent description of the event. endTime The date and time that the event ended. eventTypeCategory The category of the event type. Possible values are issue, scheduledChange, or accountNotification. eventTypeCode The unique identifier for the event type. service The AWS service that is affected by the event. startTime The date and time that the event began. statusCode The most recent status of the event. Examples of possible values are open, closed, and upcoming.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting Amazon Elasticsearch data to New Relic. This document explains the integration's features, how to activate it, and what data can be reported. Features Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads. New Relic's Elasticsearch monitoring integration allows you to track cluster status, CPU utilization, read/write latency, throughput, and other metrics, at specific points in time. Elasticsearch data is also available to query, analyze, and chart your data. Activate integration To enable this integration, follow standard procedures to connect AWS services to New Relic. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Amazon Elasticsearch integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute View and use data To view and use this integration's data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the Elasticsearch integration links. To query and explore your data, use the DatastoreSample event type with the appropriate provider value: ElasticsearchCluster for clusters ElasticsearchNode for nodes Metric data The Elasticsearch integration collects these metrics for clusters: Name Relevant statistics Description ClusterStatus.green Minimum, Maximum Indicates that all index shards are allocated to nodes in the cluster. ClusterStatus.yellow Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary shards for all indices are allocated to nodes in a cluster, but the replica shards for at least one index are not. Single node clusters always initialize with this cluster status because there is no second node to which a replica can be assigned. You can either increase your node count to obtain a green cluster status, or you can use the Amazon ES API to set the number_of_replicas setting for your index to 0. For more information, see Amazon's documentation for Updating indices settings. ClusterStatus.red Minimum, Maximum Indicates that the primary and replica shards of at least one index are not allocated to nodes in a cluster. For more information, see Amazon's documentation on Red Cluster Status. Nodes Minimum, Maximum, Average The number of nodes in the Amazon ES cluster.

A value of 1 indicates normal behavior. A value of 0 indicates that Kibana is inaccessible. In most cases, the health of Kibana mirrors the health of the cluster. KMSKeyError Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled. To restore the domain to normal operations, re-enable the key. KMSKeyInaccessible Minimum, Maximum A value of 1 indicates that the KMS customer master key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to Amazon ES. You can't recover domains that are in this state. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain. InvalidHostHeaderRequests Sum The number of HTTP requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster that included an invalid (or missing) host header. ElasticsearchRequests Sum The number of requests made to the Elasticsearch cluster. RequestCount Sum The number of requests to a domain and the HTTP response code (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) for each request.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request.

New Relic can obtain monitoring data from services and endpoints that are located in all AWS regions except from China regions. Connect AWS and New Relic In order to obtain AWS data, follow the procedure to connect AWS to New Relic, or learn more about the types of integration data that New Relic receives. The New Relic AWS integration also supports seamless deployments of your workloads using AWS Outposts. Integrations and AWS costs New Relic integrations use the Amazon CloudWatch API to obtain metrics from the AWS services you monitor. The number of calls to the CloudWatch API increases as you enable more integrations, add AWS resources to those integrations, or scale those integrations across more regions. This can cause requests to the CloudWatch API to exceed the 1 million free limits granted by AWS and increase your CloudWatch bill. View your AWS data Once you follow the configuration process, data from your Amazon Web Services will report directly to New Relic. AWS data will also be visible in the Infrastructure UI. However, unlike standard New Relic dashboards, pre-configured integrations dashboards can't be edited. To view your AWS data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. For any of the AWS integrations listed: Select an integration name to view data. OR Select the Explore data icon to view AWS data. You can view and reuse NRQL queries both in the pre-configured dashboards and in the Events explorer dashboards. This allows you to tailor queries to your specific needs.",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic.

Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps.

Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used.

Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key. In the following example the policy it's named NewRelicLicenseKeySecretReadAccess. { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"YOUR_POLICY_NAME\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME\" } ] } Copy Retrieve the default policy version: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --version-id $(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --output text --query Policy.DefaultVersionId) Copy This retrieves the policy permissions.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. Here's a brief overview of what happens during the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks.

Tip To use ECS integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. Here's a brief overview of what happens during the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key.

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY.

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. This document explains how to install this integration. Tip To use ECS integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. Here's a brief overview of what happens during the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting the on-host ECS integration, you can generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for conducting your own troubleshooting or when providing information to New Relic support. Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. You can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see Troubleshooting a running agent. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your task definition file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see Infrastructure configuration settings. You have several options for implementing verbose logs: Change the task definition environment variable and do a task restart For EC2 launch type: Retrieve logs via SSH Forward to CloudWatch and download with awscli Run a command from the running container Using task definition environment variable To enable verbose logs by changing the environment variable and doing a task restart: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. Save your task definition. Update your service to use the newly registered task definition. If you chose NRIA_VERBOSE=3 and you're not sending the logs directly to New Relic, you have two options for viewing and downloading the logs: For EC2 launch type: you can retrieve the logs via SSH, or Forward logs to CloudWatch Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by editing your task definition and setting NRIA_VERBOSE to 0. Save your task definition. Update your service to the latest version of your task. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic support: Include the line in your log file that contains the ECS integration version: New Relic ECS integration version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your task definition .yml file. Retrieve logs via SSH (EC2 launch type only) To get logs via SSH: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. SSH into one of your container instances. Find the container ID of the New Relic integration container, by running the command docker ps -a. The name of the container should be nri-ecs. Save the logs from the container with the command docker logs NRI_ECS_CONTAINER_ID > logs.txt. Leave the command running for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Continue with the instructions in the enable verbose logs section. Forward logs to CloudWatch and download them with awscli To get logs via CloudWatch: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. We use a CloudWatch log group called /newrelic-infra/ecs to forward the logs to. To see if it already exists, run: aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy If a log group exists with that prefix, you'll get this output: { \"logGroups\": [ { \"logGroupName\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs\", \"creationTime\": 1585828615225, \"metricFilterCount\": 0, \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:*\", \"storedBytes\": 122539356 } ] } Copy Because this command matches log groups with prefixes, ensure the log group name returned is exactly /newrelic-infra/ecs. If the log group doesn't exist, the output will be: { \"logGroups\": [] } Copy If the log group doesn't exist, create it by running: aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy Edit your task definition. In the container definition for the newrelic-infra container, add the following logConfiguration: \"logConfiguration\": { \"logDriver\": \"awslogs\", \"options\": { \"awslogs-group\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs\", \"awslogs-region\": \"AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER\", \"awslogs-stream-prefix\": \"verbose\" } } Copy Register the new task version and update your service. Next you'll look for the relevant log stream. If you have multiple instances of the task running, they'll all send their logs to the same log group but each will have its own log stream. Log streams names follow the structure AWSLOGS_STREAM_PREFIX/TASK_FAMILY_NAME/TASK_ID. In this case, it will be verbose/newrelic-infra/TASK_ID. To get all the log streams for a given log group, run this command: aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy The following is an example output of a log group with two streams: { \"logStreams\": [ { \"logStreamName\": \"verbose/newrelic-infra/9dfb28114e40415ebc399ec1e53a21b7\", \"creationTime\": 1586166741197, \"firstEventTimestamp\": 1586166742030, \"lastEventTimestamp\": 1586173933472, \"lastIngestionTime\": 1586175101220, \"uploadSequenceToken\": \"49599989655680038369205623273330095416487086853777112338\", \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:log-stream:verbose/newrelic-infra/9dfb28114e40415ebc399ec1e53a21b7\", \"storedBytes\": 0 }, { \"logStreamName\": \"verbose/newrelic-infra/f6ce0be416804bc4bfa658da5514eb00\", \"creationTime\": 1586166745643, \"firstEventTimestamp\": 1586166746491, \"lastEventTimestamp\": 1586173037927, \"lastIngestionTime\": 1586175100660, \"uploadSequenceToken\": \"49605664273821671319096446647846424799651902350804230514\", \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:log-stream:verbose/newrelic-infra/f6ce0be416804bc4bfa658da5514eb00\", \"storedBytes\": 0 } ] } Copy From the previous list of log streams, identify the one with the task ID for which you want to retrieve the logs and use the logStreamName in this command: aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs --log-stream-name \"LOG_STREAM_NAME\" --output text > logs.txt Copy Continue with the enable verbose logs instructions. From running container To enable verbose logs by running a command from the running container: SSH into one of your container instances. Find the container ID of the New Relic integration container by running the command docker ps -a. The name of the container should be nri-ecs. Enable verbose logs for a limited period of time by using newrelic-infra-ctl. Run the command: docker exec INTEGRATION_CONTAINER_ID /usr/bin/newrelic-infra-ctl Copy For more details, see Troubleshoot the agent. Save the logs from the container with the command docker logs INTEGRATION_CONTAINER_ID > logs.txt Copy Leave the command running for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic support: Include the line in your log file that contains the ECS integration version: New Relic ECS integration version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your task definition .yml file.",

Tip To use ECS integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. Here's a brief overview of what happens during the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key. In the following example the policy it's named NewRelicLicenseKeySecretReadAccess. { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"YOUR_POLICY_NAME\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME\" } ] } Copy Retrieve the default policy version: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --version-id $(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --output text --query Policy.DefaultVersionId) Copy This retrieves the policy permissions. There should be an entry for Actionsecretsmanager:GetSecretValue if you used AWS Secrets Manager to store your license key, or an entry for ssm:GetParametersif you used AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: AWS Secrets Manager { \"PolicyVersion\": { \"Document\": { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] }, \"VersionId\": \"v1\", \"IsDefaultVersion\": true, \"CreateDate\": \"2020-03-31T13:47:07+00:00\" } } Copy AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"ssm:GetParameters\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:ssm:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:parameter/YOUR_SECRET_NAME\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] } Copy",

One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key. In the following example the policy it's named NewRelicLicenseKeySecretReadAccess. { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"YOUR_POLICY_NAME\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME\" } ] } Copy Retrieve the default policy version: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --version-id $(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --output text --query Policy.DefaultVersionId) Copy This retrieves the policy permissions. There should be an entry for Actionsecretsmanager:GetSecretValue if you used AWS Secrets Manager to store your license key, or an entry for ssm:GetParametersif you used AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: AWS Secrets Manager { \"PolicyVersion\": { \"Document\": { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] }, \"VersionId\": \"v1\", \"IsDefaultVersion\": true, \"CreateDate\": \"2020-03-31T13:47:07+00:00\" } } Copy AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"ssm:GetParameters\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:ssm:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:parameter/YOUR_SECRET_NAME\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] } Copy",
