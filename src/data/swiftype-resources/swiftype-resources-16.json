      "body": "With the query builder, you can run queries of your data to create custom charts and other visualizations. You can also build custom dashboards containing multiple charts. Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Create NRQL alerts from the queries you build and run. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Run queries of your data to create custom charts, other visualizations, and NRQL alerts. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other available chart types to present your data in the visual format that you want to use. Share your chart. Add your chart to a dashboard. Create a NRQL alert condition from your chart.",

Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source.

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Create NRQL alerts from the queries you build and run. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Run queries of your data to create custom charts, other visualizations, and NRQL alerts. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively.

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index.

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Create NRQL alerts from the queries you build and run. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Run queries of your data to create custom charts, other visualizations, and NRQL alerts. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other available chart types to present your data in the visual format that you want to use. Share your chart. Add your chart to a dashboard.

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Numerical double values falling outside minimum or maximum Java double values Numeric double values that fall outside of a the minimum or maximum Java double value will be rejected. If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details To view details about the errors, run this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When a NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCONT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window.

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL).

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language.

Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart.

See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart.

You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the query builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Create NRQL alerts from the queries you build and run. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Run queries of your data to create custom charts, other visualizations, and NRQL alerts. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other available chart types to present your data in the visual format that you want to use. Share your chart. Add your chart to a dashboard. Create a NRQL alert condition from your chart.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "New Relic Query Language (NRQL) supports basic math functions within a SELECT clause. You can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both individual attributes as well as the results of aggregator functions. Use math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1. Advanced math functions NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. round, floor, ceil(ing) These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). ln, log2, log10, log These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting \"No Value\" back from your query. For more help",

      "body": "Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS, GCP, and Azure). Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS, GCP, and Azure). Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results.

What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "New Relic Query Language (NRQL) supports basic math functions within a SELECT clause. You can apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on both individual attributes as well as the results of aggregator functions. Use math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1. Advanced math functions NRQL includes advanced mathematical functions that can be used for complex calculations and for processing data to display more effectively in the UI. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. round, floor, ceil(ing) These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). ln, log2, log10, log These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting \"No Value\" back from your query. For more help",

      "body": "Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS, GCP, and Azure). Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics.

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.nr-data.net or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to your New Relic account: Register an Insert API key. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Register an Insert API key You must have the correct user permissions to register Insert API keys. Important Insert API keys are generated for an account. They aren't associated with a specific user. Anyone in the account with access to the Insert API key can use it. You submit multiple event types under a single Insert API key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. To register an Insert API key: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and then click Account settings. Click API keys and click Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the symbol and follow the instructions. The Insert key page lists the curl command necessary to add event data for the key. Caution For security reasons, the Insert API key cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a key, use the New Relic UI. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. The Insert key page in the Insights UI automatically generates a sample curl query for you to use as a template. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Insert-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_KEY_HERE\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"X-Insert-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The X-Insert-Key contains the correct Insert API key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, use the Insights data explorer to ensure your events are reporting correctly and to generate queries. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid API key: Invalid Insert key, or the account does not have access to Insights. Register a valid Insert key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To have New Relic Alerts notify you about parsing errors, create a NRQL condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the Insert API key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events cover many limits, resource metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIngrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' limit 200 Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit 200 Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' limit 200 Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit 200 Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit 200 Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event.

You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function.

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Simulate SQL JOIN functions Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. See Set time range on dashboards and charts for detailed information and examples. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE 'z.*|q.*'' z-app q-app hostname RLIKE 'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Note: Slashes must be escaped in the Regex pattern. For example, \\d must be \\\\d. Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. If the Regex pattern contains a capture group, the group will be ignored. That is, the group will not be captured for use later in the query. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "With NRQL, you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. When using time functions in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the WITH TIMEZONE clause in your query. Facet your NRQL query time range To create your NRQL query, use a FACET clause with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard FACET query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created) Copy Time-based functions Description yearOf(attr) Returns the year of a timestamp. quarterOf(attr) Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year. Example: Q1 2014 monthOf(attr) Returns the month and year of the timestamp. Example: July 2014 weekOf(attr) Returns the week the timestamp occurred by naming the month and day of that week's Monday. Example: Week of January 15. weekdayOf(attr) Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time. dateOf(attr) Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year. Example: July 15, 2014 dayOfMonthOf(attr) Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month. hourOf(attr) Returns the hour of the timestamp. The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as SINCE, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start. Examples: 6:00, 12:00, 18:00 Group results by month To group all results based on the month, use the monthOf function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (count(*)), a data type (PageView), a time frame (SINCE 1 day ago), and a time facet (monthOf(attribute)). SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created) Copy Running the query returns a table of results by month. Other grouping examples with FACET clause You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the NRQL FACET documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: Third-party service provider Ensure the following settings are defined: Third-party service provider: New Relic - Metrics New Relic configuration HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from all services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in CloudWatch Metric Stream is order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from poll-based AWS integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Query, dashboard, and alert considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events should work as expected. Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events might need to be adapted with dimensional metric format. Use the NRQL source for the alert condition. Entities in New Relic Explorer might be duplicated for up to 24 hours. The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects metrics. Integrations such as AWS Health, AWS Billing, and AWS CloudTrail collect additional instrumentation that's not available for metric streams. In order to continue collecting that additional data, keep those enabled as polling integrations. Troubleshooting No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This will indicate that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write to it. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal chars license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account (hint: if the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center). Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination, for example: the S3 bucket policy allows write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic does not apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you are expecting certain metrics to be ingested and it’s not the case, please verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS as part of CloudWatch. Confirm you see the metrics in the AWS CloudWatch interface. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch (for example: 1 minute, 5 minutes, etc). AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Note that there may not be any metric data been streamed due to the configured filters. Although there is no data corresponding to the configured filters, the status of the Metric Stream can be running still. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Tip To use integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

      "body": "With New Relic infrastructure integrations, you can monitor the performance of popular services, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Redis, MySQL, and more. Here are some tips on how to find, understand, and use data reported from infrastructure integrations. Explore your infrastructure integration's data The best way to understand infrastructure integrations's data and see what you can do with it is to enable an integration and explore the data in the New Relic UI. Some recommendations for exploring: View dashboards: You can find your dashboards in New Relic One. For details, see Integration dashboards. Query data: You can run custom queries and charts of your integration data. For more information, see Query New Relic data. Create alert conditions: See Alert conditions. Learn more about what metrics and inventory data an integration reports: See an integration's documentation: cloud integrations and on-host integrations. Types of integration data New Relic infrastructure integrations are separated into two main categories: Cloud integrations: Integrations for cloud platform services, including AWS, Azure, and GCP. On-host integrations: \"On-host\" refers to core services integrations that you can install directly on a host. Examples: MySQL, NGINX, Kubernetes, Redis. An infrastructure integration can generate four types of data: Metrics: Numeric measurement data. Examples: message counts, error counts, and CPU used percentage. Metric data appears in an integration's charts. For details about what metrics are reported and how to query them, see the documentation for a specific integration. For details about data structure, see Data types. Inventory: Information about the state and configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data: configuration settings, the name of the host the service is on, the AWS region, the port being used. Inventory data appears in the Inventory UI page. Inventory data also appears in integration dashboards. Changes to inventory data generates event data. Events: Events represent important activity on a system. Examples of event data: an admin logging in; a package install or uninstall; a service starting; a table being created. Most events represent changes to inventory data. Attributes: Some integrations will generate other non-metric attributes (key-value pairs) that can be queried in New Relic. Create alert conditions To create an alert condition for integration data in infrastructure, Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, choose an integration, and then select an available alert option. For more information, see Infrastructure and alerts. For on-host integrations, you can also create alert conditions using NRQL queries. (NRQL alerts are not supported or recommended for cloud integrations, due to issues related to data latency.)",

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

Release date: April 26th, 2021 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-02 Priority: Low Affected software The following New Relic agent versions are affected: Name Affected version Remediated version Java agent < 6.4.2 6.5.0 Vulnerability information A specified notation, when parsed through an unsafe Yaml.load() call, will create a new Java object and invoke its constructor, potentially leading to code execution. An attacker would have to have access to the agent’s host to edit the newrelic.yml file to include a crafted payload that would execute arbitrary code once the agent starts up. Mitigating factors This vulnerability requires an attacker already having access to the host in order to modify the newrelic.yml config file on a victim’s machine, which in itself is a mitigating factor. However, there are additional steps that you can take to either completely patch this issue or harden your systems against it: Update your Java agent to patch this vulnerability Revoke write privileges to your newrelic.yml file Workarounds Update to the latest New Relic Java agent.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted.

We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We value our relationship with you. If you have any additional questions, we encourage customers to contact us at support.newrelic.com.

An attacker would have to have access to the agent’s host to edit the newrelic.yml file to include a crafted payload that would execute arbitrary code once the agent starts up. Mitigating factors This vulnerability requires an attacker already having access to the host in order to modify the newrelic.yml config file on a victim’s machine, which in itself is a mitigating factor.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP.

Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and error_beacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

This protects data from inadvertent or intentional exposure, even if the attacker has access to the filesystem. To achieve a high level of protection while maintaining high performance and long-term storage and retrieval of data, we use a two-tier system consisting of a data encryption key (DEK) and a master key, each with separate usage, storage, and rotation policies. For an overview of how we handle your data in transit and at rest, see our data encryption documentation. This document describes the key management process for data encryption in more detail. Encryption and decryption process When encryption at rest is enabled for an account, each new file is encrypted (AES-GCM with 256 bit keys) with a data encryption key that is unique to the account and the server writing the data. Each DEK is generated locally using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module on the server. Each account’s DEK is rotated every 24 hours or when it has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. It can also be rotated manually, as-needed. The DEK that is used to encrypt a file is subsequently encrypted with the Master Key and appended in this wrapped format onto the encrypted data file. The key is encrypted remotely on our key management service (KMS), which is provided by AWS. In order to read a file, the process is reversed: First, the NRDB host on which the data resides extracts the wrapped DEK from the file and sends it to the KMS to be decrypted (unwrapped). Finally, the host decrypts the data file and processes it. Key rotation To prevent ciphertext attacks, a new data encryption key is generated per account every 24 hours or when the existing DEK has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. The master key is used only to encrypt DEKs, so a ciphertext attack against it is improbable. In compliance with FIPS guidelines, the KMS automatically rotates the master key once a year. Each New Relic region contains a single master key, which is never transmitted out of the KMS. Key handling New Relic servers generate each DEK locally, and the plain text DEK is never written to disk. If an attacker gained access to process memory, they could retrieve the unencrypted DEK for that server and time period, but they would be unable to read data from other time periods. The Master key is generated, stored, and used within a FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security module (HSM) on the KMS. Neither New Relic nor AWS employees can retrieve the plaintext of the master key. Secure generation, management, backup, storage, and destruction are all handled and guaranteed by the KMS. Administrator access to key management functions is controlled and audited using AWS permissions and CloudTrail. FedRAMP authorization In addition to our usual review process for security-critical components, New Relic’s encryption system has been reviewed by a third party and found to meet all requirements of NIST SC-28(1) Protection of Information at Rest, SC-12(3) Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management, and SC-13 Cryptographic Protection.

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the master account level, your sub-account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features. Time frames New Relic's time frames for supported regulatory frameworks and annual audits include: SOC2 Type 2 audit: Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans August 1 of the previous year through July 31 of the current year (for example, August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020). FedRAMP Agency (Moderate): Reviews New Relic's implementation and maintenance of NIST 800-53 rev. 4 controls for the previous 12 months. The annual audit spans November 28 of the previous year through November 28 of the current year (for example, November 28, 2019 through November 28, 2020). Audits In the following table: A check indicates the SOC2 or FedRAMP authorized service was included in the most recent FedRAMP annual audit. An information circle icon indicates the service will be included in upcoming annual audits and assessments. A caution icon indicates the service is on the roadmap for regulatory framework compliance at a time frame to be determined.

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and error_beacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the master account level, your sub-account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

      "body": "For customers with heightened regulatory or privacy needs, New Relic offers account-based, FIPS-compliant encryption-at-rest capabilities with unique keys per account. This protects data from inadvertent or intentional exposure, even if the attacker has access to the filesystem. To achieve a high level of protection while maintaining high performance and long-term storage and retrieval of data, we use a two-tier system consisting of a data encryption key (DEK) and a master key, each with separate usage, storage, and rotation policies. For an overview of how we handle your data in transit and at rest, see our data encryption documentation. This document describes the key management process for data encryption in more detail. Encryption and decryption process When encryption at rest is enabled for an account, each new file is encrypted (AES-GCM with 256 bit keys) with a data encryption key that is unique to the account and the server writing the data. Each DEK is generated locally using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module on the server. Each account’s DEK is rotated every 24 hours or when it has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. It can also be rotated manually, as-needed. The DEK that is used to encrypt a file is subsequently encrypted with the Master Key and appended in this wrapped format onto the encrypted data file. The key is encrypted remotely on our key management service (KMS), which is provided by AWS. In order to read a file, the process is reversed: First, the NRDB host on which the data resides extracts the wrapped DEK from the file and sends it to the KMS to be decrypted (unwrapped). Finally, the host decrypts the data file and processes it. Key rotation To prevent ciphertext attacks, a new data encryption key is generated per account every 24 hours or when the existing DEK has been used to encrypt 64 GB of data. The master key is used only to encrypt DEKs, so a ciphertext attack against it is improbable. In compliance with FIPS guidelines, the KMS automatically rotates the master key once a year. Each New Relic region contains a single master key, which is never transmitted out of the KMS. Key handling New Relic servers generate each DEK locally, and the plain text DEK is never written to disk. If an attacker gained access to process memory, they could retrieve the unencrypted DEK for that server and time period, but they would be unable to read data from other time periods. The Master key is generated, stored, and used within a FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security module (HSM) on the KMS. Neither New Relic nor AWS employees can retrieve the plaintext of the master key. Secure generation, management, backup, storage, and destruction are all handled and guaranteed by the KMS. Administrator access to key management functions is controlled and audited using AWS permissions and CloudTrail. FedRAMP authorization In addition to our usual review process for security-critical components, New Relic’s encryption system has been reviewed by a third party and found to meet all requirements of NIST SC-28(1) Protection of Information at Rest, SC-12(3) Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management, and SC-13 Cryptographic Protection. It is approved as part of our authorization for FedRAMP Moderate impact.",

This includes FIPS 140-2 compliance as well as security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). New Relic is authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. As a cloud service provider, we are committed to ensuring our compliance with FedRAMP's requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. This document describes our data encryption methods, including who gets it, what data is encrypted, and how it works. For more information, see our security documentation and Security website, or contact your account representative. Encryption in transit All New Relic customers benefit from the security provided with data encryption in transit. TLS is required for all domains. Encryption in transit Comments Who gets it Data encryption in transit is automatically included in all New Relic subscriptions. What data is encrypted Encryption in transit applies to our agents and APIs. This also applies to any third-party telemetry sources that use TLS with New Relic, such as Prometheus OpenMetrics and other integrations. How it works Uses industry-standard transport layer security (TLS). Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information about data transmission, firewalls, hosting, and storage, see our data security documentation. Disk encryption New Relic's disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). For more information, see the documentation about our Telemetry Data Platform and managing data retention. Disk-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Free for all New Relic customers where data is stored in Amazon AWS. What data is encrypted This encryption protects the physical disk where New Relic retains your data, including the following: Log management data Dimensional metrics data As we implement encryption at rest for additional telemetry types, your data will be encrypted automatically with no additional steps required by you. How it works New Relic uses Amazon AWS non-volatile, memory express SSD instance store volumes for disk-level data encryption at rest. The data on each instance storage device is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance. Encryption keys are generated using the hardware module and are unique to each instance storage device. All encryption keys are destroyed when the instance stops or terminates, and they cannot be recovered. As additional security measures: Disk-level encryption cannot be disabled. External encryption keys cannot be provided. Account-level encryption New Relic's account-level encryption at rest allows approved New Relic customers to benefit from even higher levels of security (FIPS 140-2 and FedRAMP Moderate compliant). Account-level encryption at rest Comments Who gets it Account-level data encryption depends on your New Relic subscription and your account hierarchy. For example, if your data is encrypted at the master account level, your sub-account data also is automatically encrypted at rest. Available for: Government agencies Regulated industries, such as financial institutions and healthcare Other organizations that have heightened data protection needs or require compliance with PCI, HIPAA, or FedRAMP Account-level data encryption is available for approved customers. For more information, or to request account-level encryption, contact your New Relic account representative. Approved customers must send their data to New Relic's FedRAMP compliant endpoints. What data is encrypted Account-level encryption includes: Log management data Dimensional metrics used by Telemetry SDKs, Metric API, some integrations Events Distributed traces Backups for all data with account-level encryption How it works Master key: > Key management is performed outside New Relic's database with a FIPS 140-2 certified library using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys. The FIPS-certified Key Management System (KMS) rotates annually for each per-environment master key. The master key is generated inside a hardware security module (HSM) that is not exposed or stored externally. Data encryption key: Data files are encrypted with an account-specific data encryption key (DEK) generated on our hosts and rotated daily. The data encryption key is sent to the KMS to be encrypted (wrapped) by the master key, and the wrapped data encryption key is stored along with the data file. Process: Before reading a file, a host must first send the wrapped data encryption key to the KMS to be decrypted. To improve performance, an unwrapped data encryption key is cached temporarily on the host. For more information, see our documentation about key management for encryption at rest.",

Secured content Data for New Relic accounts are isolated so that users can only see the data for accounts they own (or have been given permission to see). New Relic also has certain rights regarding customers' data, described in the Terms and Conditions page on the New Relic website. Analytics In order to help us improve our product and user experience, New Relic uses third-party analytics services to better understand the behavior of users on our site. The user data that New Relic collects is used solely by New Relic and is not shared, sold, or rented to any third parties for their own use. For more information, see our Services data privacy notice. Data transmission and firewalls The New Relic agent communicates with two hosts: collector.newrelic.com collector-nnn.newrelic.com, where nnn is a numerical value Typically the numbered host is fixed for your account, and it appears in log/newrelic.agent.log. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Hosting and data storage New Relic is self-hosted with co-location services called Server Central in a Tier 3 data center in Chicago, Illinois and an IBM-hosted data center near Frankfurt, Germany, as well as cloud storage through Amazon AWS. We use standard best practices to maintain a firewall for our servers and to protect our servers from unauthorized login. All data is stored in a cluster of MySQL databases. New Relic data is backed up nightly, and an archive is stored at a secondary data center. Data access Access to account data by New Relic employees is limited to a necessary set of users consistent with their assigned New Relic responsibilities. Except to the extent necessary to provide subscribed services and as documented in our Services data privacy notice, customer account data is not shared with any third parties. All customer account data access is logged and regularly audited. HTTP parameters disabled by default By default, New Relic agents disable collection of HTTP request parameters, such as the query string of a URL. This is an automatic safeguard to protect potentially sensitive data. New Relic collects and displays HTTP parameters only when you explicitly enable them in your agent configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data Our Telemetry Data Platform is the single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more information about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage (NrDailyUsage) To view daily usage of New Relic for your selected account for billing purposes, query NrDailyUsage events. For more information about available NrDailyUsageattributes, see our data dictionary. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by Browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Insights The Insights service reports on data recorded by other New Relic products and services. It doesn’t record data on its own. For more information, see the Insights documentation about default data from other products and services. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Open source on-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our Logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the Logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The Logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. New Relic One New Relic One is a connected, unified UI that gathers all the data you already monitor with New Relic in one place. It is not a product, but rather, it's a way to interact with all your New Relic data more easily. For more information, see the introduction and security documentation for New Relic One. Plugins The plugins service allows you to publish publicly accessible plugins within (Plugin Central. Anyone who has a New Relic account can install and use these plugins through their New Relic user interface. For some plugins, New Relic, Inc. is the publisher, and will be clearly identified as the publisher in Plugin Central. For plugins in Plugin Central that are not created by New Relic, the plugin publisher must follow specific guidelines. For more information, see the Plugins security documentation. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document describes how New Relic protects the security of your data. For more information about our security measures, see our data privacy documentation and the New Relic Security website. Secured content Data for New Relic accounts are isolated so that users can only see the data for accounts they own (or have been given permission to see). New Relic also has certain rights regarding customers' data, described in the Terms and Conditions page on the New Relic website. Analytics In order to help us improve our product and user experience, New Relic uses third-party analytics services to better understand the behavior of users on our site. The user data that New Relic collects is used solely by New Relic and is not shared, sold, or rented to any third parties for their own use. For more information, see our Services data privacy notice. Data transmission and firewalls The New Relic agent communicates with two hosts: collector.newrelic.com collector-nnn.newrelic.com, where nnn is a numerical value Typically the numbered host is fixed for your account, and it appears in log/newrelic.agent.log. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Hosting and data storage New Relic is self-hosted with co-location services called Server Central in a Tier 3 data center in Chicago, Illinois and an IBM-hosted data center near Frankfurt, Germany, as well as cloud storage through Amazon AWS. We use standard best practices to maintain a firewall for our servers and to protect our servers from unauthorized login. All data is stored in a cluster of MySQL databases. New Relic data is backed up nightly, and an archive is stored at a secondary data center. Data access Access to account data by New Relic employees is limited to a necessary set of users consistent with their assigned New Relic responsibilities. Except to the extent necessary to provide subscribed services and as documented in our Services data privacy notice, customer account data is not shared with any third parties. All customer account data access is logged and regularly audited. HTTP parameters disabled by default By default, New Relic agents disable collection of HTTP request parameters, such as the query string of a URL. This is an automatic safeguard to protect potentially sensitive data. New Relic collects and displays HTTP parameters only when you explicitly enable them in your agent configuration file.",

However, a new service may not be covered by one or more of our compliance programs at any given time throughout the year. This is primarily dependent on the timing when the service achieved General Availability (GA) status and the timing of the specific compliance program's annual authorization, certification, or assessment. You can use any New Relic service regardless of its compliance program status. However, if a service is not yet in scope of our compliance programs, we encourage you to consider your risk appetite in the decision to use the specific New Relic product or service. If you choose to use New Relic services that are not yet in our compliance program scope, you assume the responsibility to review, understand, and risk-manage your security controls as you deem appropriate. You also have the option to wait for New Relic to authorize these services before you use them.",

For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data Our Telemetry Data Platform is the single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more information about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage (NrDailyUsage) To view daily usage of New Relic for your selected account for billing purposes, query NrDailyUsage events. For more information about available NrDailyUsageattributes, see our data dictionary. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by Browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Insights The Insights service reports on data recorded by other New Relic products and services. It doesn’t record data on its own. For more information, see the Insights documentation about default data from other products and services. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Open source on-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our Logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the Logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The Logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. New Relic One New Relic One is a connected, unified UI that gathers all the data you already monitor with New Relic in one place. It is not a product, but rather, it's a way to interact with all your New Relic data more easily. For more information, see the introduction and security documentation for New Relic One. Plugins The plugins service allows you to publish publicly accessible plugins within (Plugin Central. Anyone who has a New Relic account can install and use these plugins through their New Relic user interface. For some plugins, New Relic, Inc. is the publisher, and will be clearly identified as the publisher in Plugin Central. For plugins in Plugin Central that are not created by New Relic, the plugin publisher must follow specific guidelines. For more information, see the Plugins security documentation. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Software built at New Relic for our generally available New Relic One platform goes through these five phases. Software development phase Security control Requirements Risk assessment Design Threat modeling Development Secure coding standards and practices Verification Code review, security review, static code analysis, composition analysis, calculated hash, signed code Deploy Hacker One and the New Relic coordinated disclosure program, regular scans, third-party penetration tests Requirements Each project team for our generally available New Relic One platform is assigned a security engineer charged with reviewing and advising on the security of New Relic products. In the requirements building phase the security engineer performs a risk assessment and then adds security requirements for the project. Privacy and compliance experts are added to the project teams as needed. Design During the design phase, the New Relic security engineer collaborates with the stakeholders, engineering leaders, and architects to get a detailed shared understanding of the feature. Security engineers at New Relic contribute to the design process with stakeholders by creating a threat model documenting any acceptance criteria, features, or requirements to securely implement the feature. Using the threat model, the security engineer adds detailed specifications for the required controls to the project. Build Each product engineer receives secure coding training which includes topics such as the OWASP top 10, input sanitization, and using the secure frameworks and process already in place at New Relic. In the build phase the engineering team implements appropriate security features in the project following secure coding standards at New Relic. Verification Once feature complete, every pull request must be code reviewed by another engineer with write access to the code repository. In addition to code scanning software automatically checking for vulnerabilities against security policies, security engineers verify that safeguards and controls recommended in design, requirements, and assessment phases were implemented when needed.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Our commitment to our customers At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor.

Software development phase Security control Requirements Risk assessment Design Threat modeling Development Secure coding standards and practices Verification Code review, security review, static code analysis, composition analysis, calculated hash, signed code Deploy Hacker One and the New Relic coordinated disclosure program, regular scans, third-party penetration tests Requirements Each project team for our generally available New Relic One platform is assigned a security engineer charged with reviewing and advising on the security of New Relic products. In the requirements building phase the security engineer performs a risk assessment and then adds security requirements for the project. Privacy and compliance experts are added to the project teams as needed. Design During the design phase, the New Relic security engineer collaborates with the stakeholders, engineering leaders, and architects to get a detailed shared understanding of the feature. Security engineers at New Relic contribute to the design process with stakeholders by creating a threat model documenting any acceptance criteria, features, or requirements to securely implement the feature. Using the threat model, the security engineer adds detailed specifications for the required controls to the project. Build Each product engineer receives secure coding training which includes topics such as the OWASP top 10, input sanitization, and using the secure frameworks and process already in place at New Relic. In the build phase the engineering team implements appropriate security features in the project following secure coding standards at New Relic. Verification Once feature complete, every pull request must be code reviewed by another engineer with write access to the code repository. In addition to code scanning software automatically checking for vulnerabilities against security policies, security engineers verify that safeguards and controls recommended in design, requirements, and assessment phases were implemented when needed. New Relic performs static code and composition analysis to look for vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies. Deploy New Relic is in the process of including hashes and signatures. Anyone downloading files published by New Relic will be able to confirm their downloaded file has not been tampered with and is identical to the one published by New Relic.

      "body": "October 9, 2018 This is a summary of the 2018 security breach of the systems of Apollo.io and New Relic's response. Security officer statement Over the weekend, New Relic was alerted by a sales productivity tool vendor, Apollo.io, about a security breach of their systems, which contained business-card-like customer contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. We are actively investigating this issue, and at this time we believe that a subset of our customers’ and prospects’ contact info may have been included. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors. Please follow discuss.newrelic.com/c/security-notifications for additional information on this incident. - Shaun Gordon, VP, Chief Security Officer, New Relic Summary of incident Who is affected? We are currently investigating who is impacted, but we believe that the vendor’s breach was limited to business contact information. What happened? New Relic was recently notified by Apollo.io that personal data that we shared with them in accordance with our Privacy Policy was exposed by a breach. We then started our investigation to learn more about the scope of the data involved. Our privacy policy is described further at: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo, but shared it solely to assist in providing services to New Relic. What data was compromised? We are continuing our investigation, but we believe that customer or potential customer email addresses, company names, business contact information, and the names of the customers to whom those emails relate were potentially exposed. We believe that no financial account information (e.g. credit card numbers, bank account numbers, etc.), government issued identification numbers (e.g. social security numbers or passport numbers) or sensitive categories of personal data as defined under GDPR (e.g. medical information, religious preference, etc.) was exposed. What action did New Relic take? We have reached out to Apollo.io requesting additional information and are continuing to investigate internally. What further actions will New Relic take? Based on our continuing investigation, we will provide further information as appropriate. Do you need to notify EU data protection authorities of this incident? No. As explained above, New Relic is the “data controller” of the contact information that was exposed as a result of this incident. Accordingly, and in keeping with our responsibilities as a “data controller” under the GDPR, we will submit a notice to our lead data protection authority. We will not disclose any customer information as part of this notice. Update and resolution November 5, 2018 Apollo.io, a sales intelligence vendor, was notified about a security breach of their systems by an external security researcher. The data involved contained business-card-like contact information such as name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. After investigation of this issue, we determined that a specific set of New Relic customer and prospect contact info had been included but we have found no evidence of misuse. Per our request, all data from New Relic obtained by Apollo.io has been purged from their systems. New Relic did not sell the data to Apollo.io, but shared it solely as part of using the vendor service, which means that New Relic was the “data controller” of the impacted information and Apollo.io our “data processor” as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). No customer data from the New Relic product platform (for which New Relic acts as “data processor”) was ever linked with Apollo.io 30’s services or was impacted. At New Relic, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is paramount, and we practice strict information security policies for engaging any third-party vendor. We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes across all vendors.

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic provides working minimal examples as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions, so that you can become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and use them as a reference for your own instrumentation. While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic provides working minimal examples as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions, so that you can become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and use them as a reference for your own instrumentation. While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "After enabling our monitoring for AWS Lambda, you should occasionally update our Lambda function that's used to report AWS log data: newrelic-log-ingestion. There are two ways to do this: Update via CLI: Use this if you enabled our Lambda monitoring using our CLI tool. Update via AWS Serverless Application Repository: Use this if you enabled using the manual procedure. Important These update procedures apply to our serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda, and not to our infrastructure monitoring for AWS Lambda integration. Update our Lambda integration via CLI This section describes how to update if your Lambda monitoring was enabled using our recommended CLI tool. Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy For each region in which you've installed the newrelic-log-ingestion function, run the following command, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region identifier (for example, us-west-2). newrelic-lambda integrations update \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy If you do not have our logs enabled, you'll also need to update your Amazon CloudWatch log subscription filters with the following command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install \\ --function installed \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Update layers via CLI This section describes how to update your function's Layer if you installed it with our CLI tool. Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy Pass the --upgrade flag to the install command: newrelic-lambda layers install \\ --function installed \\ --nr-account-id NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --upgrade Copy Update a manual Serverless application repository install If you manually installed the ingest function from the AWS Serverless Application Repository (and didn't use the CLI), update using this procedure: Run the following, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region (for example, us-west-2). aws serverlessrepo create-cloud-formation-change-set \\ --application-id arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion \\ --stack-name NewRelic-log-ingestion \\ --capabilities CAPABILITY_RESOURCE_POLICY \\ --region YOUR_REGION Copy This command outputs several fields, one of which is the ChangeSetId: an ARN for the change set that you just created. Copy that ARN. Use the ARN in this command, which executes the change set: aws cloudformation execute-change-set --change-set-name YOUR_CHANGE_SET_ARN Copy Enabling log management If you currently don't have New Relic's log management enabled, but would like to: Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy For each region in which you've installed the newrelic-log-ingestion function, run the following command, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region (for example, us-west-2). newrelic-lambda integrations update \\ --enable-logs \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Then do either of the following: Update your Amazon CloudWatch log subscription filters for each region with the following command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install \\ --function installed \\ --filter-pattern \"\" \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Or, you can send function logs to New Relic directly, bypassing CloudWatch and the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. To do this, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_EXTENSION_SEND_FUNCTION_LOGS=true in your Lambda function configuration. After that, be sure to remove any existing New Relic log subscriptions for that function using this command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions uninstall \\ --function FUNCTION_NAME \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy If the log subscription is present while the extension is sending logs, logs will be sent twice, resulting in duplicate log records in New Relic. Optionally, if you'd like to avoid Amazon's charges for CloudWatch Log ingestion, you can also modify your function's execution role so that it doesn't grant the CloudWatch Log permissions. This will prevent your function from logging to CloudWatch. Caution CloudWatch Logs ingest fees can be considerable, but this step should be taken with caution. Make sure your New Relic log ingestion integration is working well and meeting your needs before disabling CloudWatch logs.",

Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "After enabling our monitoring for AWS Lambda, you should occasionally update our Lambda function that's used to report AWS log data: newrelic-log-ingestion. There are two ways to do this: Update via CLI: Use this if you enabled our Lambda monitoring using our CLI tool. Update via AWS Serverless Application Repository: Use this if you enabled using the manual procedure. Important These update procedures apply to our serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda, and not to our infrastructure monitoring for AWS Lambda integration. Update our Lambda integration via CLI This section describes how to update if your Lambda monitoring was enabled using our recommended CLI tool. Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy For each region in which you've installed the newrelic-log-ingestion function, run the following command, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region identifier (for example, us-west-2). newrelic-lambda integrations update \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy If you do not have our logs enabled, you'll also need to update your Amazon CloudWatch log subscription filters with the following command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install \\ --function installed \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Update layers via CLI This section describes how to update your function's Layer if you installed it with our CLI tool. Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy Pass the --upgrade flag to the install command: newrelic-lambda layers install \\ --function installed \\ --nr-account-id NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --upgrade Copy Update a manual Serverless application repository install If you manually installed the ingest function from the AWS Serverless Application Repository (and didn't use the CLI), update using this procedure: Run the following, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region (for example, us-west-2). aws serverlessrepo create-cloud-formation-change-set \\ --application-id arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion \\ --stack-name NewRelic-log-ingestion \\ --capabilities CAPABILITY_RESOURCE_POLICY \\ --region YOUR_REGION Copy This command outputs several fields, one of which is the ChangeSetId: an ARN for the change set that you just created. Copy that ARN. Use the ARN in this command, which executes the change set: aws cloudformation execute-change-set --change-set-name YOUR_CHANGE_SET_ARN Copy Enabling log management If you currently don't have New Relic's log management enabled, but would like to: Make sure you have the latest version of the CLI: pip install --upgrade newrelic-lambda-cli Copy For each region in which you've installed the newrelic-log-ingestion function, run the following command, replacing YOUR_REGION with your region (for example, us-west-2). newrelic-lambda integrations update \\ --enable-logs \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Then do either of the following: Update your Amazon CloudWatch log subscription filters for each region with the following command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install \\ --function installed \\ --filter-pattern \"\" \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy Or, you can send function logs to New Relic directly, bypassing CloudWatch and the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda. To do this, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_EXTENSION_SEND_FUNCTION_LOGS=true in your Lambda function configuration. After that, be sure to remove any existing New Relic log subscriptions for that function using this command: newrelic-lambda subscriptions uninstall \\ --function FUNCTION_NAME \\ --aws-region YOUR_REGION Copy If the log subscription is present while the extension is sending logs, logs will be sent twice, resulting in duplicate log records in New Relic. Optionally, if you'd like to avoid Amazon's charges for CloudWatch Log ingestion, you can also modify your function's execution role so that it doesn't grant the CloudWatch Log permissions. This will prevent your function from logging to CloudWatch. Caution CloudWatch Logs ingest fees can be considerable, but this step should be taken with caution. Make sure your New Relic log ingestion integration is working well and meeting your needs before disabling CloudWatch logs.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java.

For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Copy Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Copy Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public override Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // This call will block by calling task.Result Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Copy Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save Copy In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic Copy Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It is organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda. Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Copy Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Copy Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public override Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // This call will block by calling task.Result Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Copy Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save Copy In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic Copy Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "New Relic provides working minimal examples as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions, so that you can become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and use them as a reference for your own instrumentation. While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate Distributed Tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our Distributed Tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It is organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our GitHub repo for an example of an instrumented Lambda. Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Copy Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Copy Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.1.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public override Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // This call will block by calling task.Result Task<int> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Copy Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save Copy In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic Copy Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a sub-account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Important Because there are several steps to integration, it's important that you test your account link by deploying and testing an example function before instrumenting your own code. Deployment strategies There are many different deployment strategies for Lambda functions. New Relic offers direct support for several, but we cannot cover every option. At its core, New Relic Lambda instrumentation relies on the Lambda service itself, rather than any particular deployment strategy or tool, so we're confident that it can be made to work in your use case. newrelic-lambda CLI quickstart The CLI tool that we recommended for setting up the account link can also reconfigure your Lambda functions to use New Relic. To install or upgrade the New Relic instrumentation layer, run: newrelic-lambda layers install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID --function my-function --upgrade Copy This command automatically finds the newest available layer for your Lambda's region and runtime. This is a great way to quick-start instrumentation, and this tool can easily be integrated into your existing CI/CD processes. However, since it modifies existing Lambda function resources, when you deploy a code update to your function, you may inadvertently remove the New Relic instrumentation. Be sure to re-run the command above after every update, or (even better) integrate the layer and associated configuration with your existing deployment process. Note that the CLI can operate on many functions in a batch: use --function all, --function installed, or --function not-installed to operate on all functions in a region, or only those with or without existing New Relic instrumentation. Continuous deployment In the long term, it's usually less work to integrate New Relic into your existing continuous deployment process. Instead of running the CLI after updating your function, you can integrate New Relic into your continuous deployment framework. CloudFormation / SAM templates AWS's Serverless Application Model, or SAM is a variant of CloudFormation templates that simplifies relating functions to the resources they depend on, and managing the lifecycle of an entire application. We use SAM and CloudFormation for most of our Lambda example functions, and many other tools are built on top of CloudFormation templates, providing an addition layer of abstraction. At its core, CloudFormation is a way to express the target state of an AWS Resource (such as a Lambda function) using YAML or JSON, and an execution service that makes API calls to other services (such as AWS Lambda) to achieve that target state. Here's an example of a simple CloudFormation template for a NodeJS Lambda function: AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09' Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: And example of a simple instrumented NodeJS Lambda Resources: NewRelicExample: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: # In this example, we're using the SAM CLI to package and deploy our lambda. SAM will transform this value during the publish step. CodeUri: newrelic-example-node/ # The handler for your function needs to be the one provided by the instrumentation layer, below. Handler: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler Runtime: nodejs12.x Environment: Variables: # For the instrumentation handler to invoke your real handler, we need this value NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: app.lambdaHandler # Distributed tracing needs your account ID, and your trusted account ID NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE # If your New Relic account has a parent account, this value should be that account ID. Otherwise, just # your account id. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: YOUR_PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE Layers: # This layer includes the New Relic Lambda Extension, a sidecar process that sends telemetry, # as well as the New Relic Agent for Node.js, and a handler wrapper that makes integration easy. - !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:lambda:${AWS::Region}:451483290750:layer:NewRelicNodeJS12X:34 Policies: # This policy allows the lambda to know the value of the New Relic licence key. We need this so # that we can send telemetry back to New Relic - AWSSecretsManagerGetSecretValuePolicy: SecretArn: !ImportValue NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-NewRelic-LicenseKeySecretARN Copy Conventionally, you'll have a file named template.yaml that describes your function, and its resources. Serverless Framework Serverless Framework is a popular development and deployment tool for serverless applications. It's written in NodeJS, and for AWS, acts mostly as a higher-level abstraction on top of CloudFormation templates. It works well for Node, Python and Java functions. New Relic offers a Serverless Framework Plugin to simplify instrumentation of your Serverless Framework application. Install the plugin First, npm install --save-dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Or, alternatively, yarn add --dev serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers Copy Find your New Relic Account ID, your New Relic Personal API Key Then add the following to your serverless.yaml file: plugins: - serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers custom: newRelic: accountId: your-new-relic-account-id-here apiKey: your-new-relic-personal-api-key-here Copy Terraform Terraform is a popular general-purpose infrastructure as code tool. It can be used to manage AWS resources, as well as many other things. We offer some examples of New Relic instrumented Lambda functions deployed using Terraform scripts. Unusual integrations For most, one of the options above will work well. There's a chance that you can't use any of these solutions though. For guidance on how to customize your integration to fit your needs, read on. CloudWatch telemetry As mentioned previously we used to recommend sending your telemetry through CloudWatch Logs. This path can still work, though it is deprecated. Disable the extension by adding the NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_EXTENSION_ENABLED environment variable to your function, with the value false. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion function with the logs for your function. The CLI can do this for you: newrelic-lambda subscriptions install --function <var>FUNCTION_NAME</var> Alternatively, use the AWS Console to create a subscription filter from your function's CloudWatch Log Group to invoke the newrelic-log-ingestion lambda function. See below. Manual process: Stream CloudWatch logs to New Relic Lambda Open CloudWatch and select Logs in the left-hand menu, and then select the log group for the function you are monitoring. Select Actions and choose Stream to AWS Lambda. Under Lambda function, select the newrelic-log-ingestion function. Set the Log format to JSON. Set the Subscription filter pattern to ?REPORT ?NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING ?\"Task timed out\" ?RequestId. Alternatively, if you are using the LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable stream all your logs to our Logs, leave this field blank. See notes and caveats about this procedure. Important Make sure the newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function you select in the method above is in the same AWS region as your Lambda function. Lambda console UI configuration While it is more error prone and labor intensive than the approaches above, it's possible to manually alter the configuration of a Lambda function to use New Relic from the AWS Lambda Console, for NodeJS, Python and Java. Find the layer that matches your runtime and region. Copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the most recent version and add it in the AWS Lambda console for your function. Update your function's handler to point to the newly attached layer in the console for your function: Python: newrelic_lambda_wrapper.handler (underscores) Node: newrelic-lambda-wrapper.handler (hyphens) Java: RequestHandler implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleRequest RequestStreamHandlerWrapper implementation: com.newrelic.java.HandlerWrapper::handleStreamsRequest Add these environment variables to your Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: Your account ID NEW_RELIC_LAMBDA_HANDLER: Path to your initial handler. Modify the Execution Role to allow access to the New Relic License Key secret Find the ARN of the secret named NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Add a new inline policy in the function's execution role that looks like this (replacing the SECRET_ARN with the value you found above): \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": [ \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\" ], \"Resource\": \"SECRET_ARN\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] Copy Note that for Go and .NET, you must make source code changes to your Lambda function to instrument it. Configuration changes are not enough. Layer customization The layer contains several components, depending on your runtime: For all runtimes, the extension executable is packaged in the layer. For Python, NodeJS and Java, we also include: The New Relic Agent The AWS SDK instrumentation package for the New Relic Agent A handler wrapper, which configures the agent, and intercepts invocations, to start the instrumentation process, then invokes your handler. If you need a different wrapper, you can build your own layer, based on ours. See our newrelic-lambda-layers GitHub repo for the code contained in our wrapper function. By creating your own layer with a replacement wrapper, and applying it after ours, your wrapper will overwrite the one we supply. Similarly, you can include your custom wrapper directly in your function. Similarly, if you are testing a custom build of the agent, perhaps to address some bug, you could modify our layer packaging scripts above to package your agent build, and build your own layer. We explicitly do not recommend that you package the agent with your Lambda function. While this is possible, it makes it difficult for you to upgrade the agent and receive bug fixes. The layer may conflict with your vendored agent. Such a configuration should be regarded as unsupported, though it can work. What's next? After you complete these steps, here's what you can do next: See data reporting in the Lambda monitoring UI. If you're having trouble finding your data, see Lambda enable troubleshooting.",

      "body": "When you link your AWS account to New Relic, you're granting permission to New Relic to create an inventory of your AWS account, and gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. Resources in your AWS account then show up as entities in the entity explorer, decorated with config information. AWS permissions details To create this inventory, we need an IAM role that grants these IAM permissions, at a minimum: Resource: \"*\" Action: \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\" \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\" \"cloudwatch:GetMetricData\" \"lambda:GetAccountSettings\" \"lambda:ListFunctions\" \"lambda:ListAliases\" \"lambda:ListTags\" \"lambda:ListEventSourceMappings\" Copy By default, we use the AWS Managed Policy ReadOnlyAccess. This allows the Infrastructure integration to see all the resources in your account, rather than just your Lambda functions and CloudWatch metrics. New Relic recommends this default, but we understand that some organizations have a very conservative security posture for third party integrations. A role with the permissions above is sufficient to allow Lambda telemetry collection, though traces that interact with other services may not work well. In this integration step, we'll also store your New Relic License Key in the AWS Secrets Manager service, so that we can send your telemetry to your New Relic account. Recommended method: The newrelic-lambda CLI Requirements To enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you need the following: AWS CLI v2 installed and configured using aws configure. Python version 3.3 or higher installed. newrelic-lambda CLI, which you can install by running pip3 install newrelic-lambda-cli. A New Relic account. You must be an admin, or have the Infrastructure manager add-on role. A user key. An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets. CLI user AWS permissions details The CLI uses the AWS SDK to interact with AWS. The SDK will act using the same default profile as the AWS CLI. This profile needs, at a minimum, the following AWS permissions to run the CLI. Resource: * Actions: \"cloudformation:CreateChangeSet\", \"cloudformation:CreateStack\", \"cloudformation:DescribeStacks\", \"cloudformation:ExecuteChangeSets\", \"iam:AttachRolePolicy\", \"iam:CreateRole\", \"iam:GetRole\", \"iam:PassRole\", \"lambda:AddPermission\", \"lambda:CreateFunction\", \"lambda:GetFunction\", \"logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter\", \"logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters\", \"logs:PutSubscriptionFilter\" \"s3:GetObject\" \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationChangeSet\" \"secretsmanager:CreateSecret\" Resource: \"arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:463657938898:applications/NewRelic-log-ingestion\" Actions: \"serverlessrepo:CreateCloudFormationTemplate\" \"serverlessrepo:GetCloudFormationTemplate\" Copy Integrate with CLI When all the requirements are in place, link your AWS account with your New Relic account by running the following command using your user key (replace all the highlighted values): AWS regions and profiles Setting the region To configure your region, use this environment variable to override the default region: export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=MY_REGION # us-west-2, for example Copy The CLI tool also allows passing this per-command using --aws-region. Setting profiles If you have multiple AWS profiles and don't want to use the default, use AWS_PROFILE environment variable to set another profile name. Ensure the profile is properly configured (including the default region). Example: export AWS_PROFILE=MY_PROFILE Copy newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --nr-api-key YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY Copy The newrelic-lambda CLI adds your New Relic license key as a secret in [AWS Secret Manager] (https://aws.amazon. com/secrets-manager/) for greater security. Tip Storing the New Relic license key in the AWS Secrets Manager Your New Relic license key identifies and authenticates you to New Relic, allowing us to associate your telemetry with your New Relic account. Each function that sends telemetry needs access to this value, and it needs to be managed securely. The AWS Secrets Manager solves these problems. If your organization prevents you from using AWS Secrets Manager or if you need to store more than one secret per region, see below for an alternative method to set your license key. Alternative method Linking accounts manually The Infrastructure UI The CLI is the least complicated way to link your accounts. Current CLI behavior limits the setup of one managed secret per region. If you need more control or need to integrate more than one New Relic account per region, you can go through the linking process manually. Be sure to enable Lambda when selecting services to be monitored. Don't forget to configure the License Key Secret manually, as described next. Manually Configuring the License Key Secret In addition to linking your accounts, you'll need to configure the license key secret. Download this CloudFormation Template: license-key-secret.yaml Using the AWS CLI, or the AWS CloudFormation Console, install the template, supplying the LicenseKey parameter. You can find your New Relic License Key here. It will be labeled \"INGEST - LICENSE\". Be sure to use the license key for the account you configured with the Infrastructure UI above. AWS CLI example: Be sure to replace YOUR_LICENSE_KEY with the license key you found above. aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name NewRelicLicenseKeySecret \\ --template-body file://license-key-secret.yaml \\ --parameters 'ParameterKey=LicenseKey,ParameterValue=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Troubleshooting Cannot Use AWS secrets manager If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension will accept a NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable. Add the --disable-license-key-secret flag from the newrelic-lambda integrations install command. Then set this environment variable to your New Relic license key in your Lambda function configuration. Multiple AWS regions and accounts The newrelic-lambda CLI should be run once per region, with the --aws-region parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The license key secret needs to be created in each region. Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The --aws-profile argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI. Failure to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. In our examples, check out the template.yaml file to see an easy way to grant this permission. Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN> Copy",

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

The data displayed in the UI is a combination of these data sources. For example, the Overview page displays data reported by instrumentation, while the Metrics page displays CloudWatch data. Event definitions and attributes Lambda data is stored in our database (NRDB) as events (data objects with associated attributes). Lambda data is attached to the following event types. Select an event name to see its attributes. AwsLambdaInvocation event: Captures overall timing and associated metadata. A Lambda invocation generates a single AwsLambdaInvocation event. AwsLambdaInvocationError event: If an error occurs during a Lambda, this event will be generated. Span: This includes detail about a segment of a Lambda function. Spans are used for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing relies on data sampling; 10% of invocations are sampled to generate spans. Custom event types: With some agent APIs, custom events can be created and associated with a particular Lambda invocation, and then queried with NRQL.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK.

Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Tip To use serverless monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring. Next steps: Enable and use Lambda monitoring To get started using our Lambda monitoring, see the installation and enablement instructions. You can also set up alerts or add your own custom events or attributes.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). If it's easy to include that detail in the short description, do so, but it's not required. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use single quotes to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when 'category' is 'http'). We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a link 'See attribute in docs' that links to the docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description This API call sends a Browser PageAction event with your user-defined name and optional attributes to dashboards, along with several default attributes. This is useful to track any event that is not already tracked automatically by the Browser agent, such as clicking a Subscribe button or accessing a tutorial. PageAction events are sent to New Relic One every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that harvest cycle. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name or category of the action. Reports to New Relic One as the actionName attribute. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute or value. $attributes JSON object Optional. JSON object with one or more key/value pairs. For example: {key:\"value\"}. The key will report to New Relic One as its own PageAction attribute with the specified values. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Record link clicks (JavaScript) This example records a PageAction event whenever a user selects the Try Me link. The event is recorded with an actionName of clickedTryMe: < a href=\"/demo\" id=\"try-me\" >Try Me!< /a> <script> document.getElementById('try-me').addEventListener('click',function (e) { newrelic.addPageAction('clickedTryMe'); }) </script> Copy You can then query the number of times the Try Me button was clicked with the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='clickedTryMe' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Record link clicks (jQuery) This example sends a PageAction event when a user clicks on an element with the class copy-text. The actionName is copy-text-button and the value is reported as another attribute called Result that corresponds to methods named success and error that handle the outcome. $('.copy-text').click(function (){ var clipboard = new Clipboard ('.copy-text'); clipboard.on('success', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'success'}); } }); clipboard.on('error', function(event) { // Do stuff // Report data to New Relic One if (typeof newrelic == 'object') { newrelic.addPageAction('copy-text-button', {result: 'error'}); } }); }); Copy Then in the query builder, you can create a pie chart to see the breakdown of how many button clicks resulted in success versus error over the past 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET result SINCE 30 days ago Copy Or you can create a query to see what pages have the most copy button clicks in the last 30 days: SELECT count(*) AS 'Clicks' FROM PageAction WHERE actionName = 'copy-text-button' FACET currentUrl SINCE 30 days ago Copy Capture form input This example captures user input (email addresses) from a form called Signup. The event is recorded with an actionName of userSignup: <form action=\"/signup\" id=\"myform\"> <input id=\"email\" name=\"email\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Signup\"> </form> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> document.getElementById('myform').addEventListener('submit', function (e) { var email = e.target.elements['email'].value; newrelic.addPageAction('userSignup', {email: email}); }) </script> Copy You can then see the emails that you gathered with the following NRQL query: SELECT uniques(email) FROM PageAction WHERE actionName='userSignup' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy",

The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your apps in New Relic Browser, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific Browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by Browser application ID: To view a specific Browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your Browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Ideally, one line or less on the \"View all methods\" page. Requirements Agent version 1.2.3.4 or higher. Additional requirements on their own line (do not use bullets). Do not use any callouts. If there are no special requirements, write: Compatible with all agent versions. Description Describe the behavior of the call with as much detail as possible. Do not describe what individual parameters do except in broad strokes; details of parameters and call variants belong under the Parameters heading. Similarly, do not describe return values. When cross-referencing another API call, format its name with code blocks, and include parentheses () like this: anotherCoolMethod(). Tip You can include callouts, but use discretion. These pages are already visually busy. Parameters If there are no parameters, leave this section blank. If there is only one call variant, do not include a syntax block in this section. Parameter Description newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name[, integer $optional_param]) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $optional_param integer Optional. Brief description of parameter. newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name, array $different_param) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $different_param array Required. Brief description of parameter. $third_param string Required. Brief description of parameter.

If the call does not return anything, leave this section blank. Examples This section documents rules for oddballs that aren't self-documenting. The rest of the examples are embedded within the page itself. In general, this page is intended for style reference. For examples of how to write good API method pages, check out our existing API docs, such as the PHP API. URL guidelines For the doc's URL: Manually edit the URL slug to remove the agent name. Where the API call does not already include separators (as in newrelic_awesome_call), separate the bits with hyphens -. For example: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/writing-guidelines/api-style-guidelines Copy Title guidelines For the doc's title: Include the method name and the agent name in parentheses. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses () in the call itself. For example: apiStyleGuidelines (Example agent API) Copy Short title guidelines For the doc's short title: Include only the method name. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses (). Adjust if necessary to fit on a single line in the category's sidebar. For example: apiStyleGuidelines Copy Syntax guidelines Important The Python and iOS agents use their own guidelines. For those guidelines, see the existing methods in those languages. Document each variant of a call on its own line. Do not use any formatting except italicizing the data type. Wrap optional parameters (including the comma separator) in square brackets []. Indicate the variable portion by prefacing it with a dollar sign $. If the call must be prefixed with newrelic. or similar, include that in the syntax. Optional: Include the return value, if that seems important for your particular agent. If you do, follow language conventions.",

      "body": "This document is a template for an API tutorial document: Please skim the entire template first to understand the expected structure for this type of doc. Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in New Relic APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

Read on for more information about our page types. Docs meta content (frontmatter) Thr top of every doc begins with a set of metadata. Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:). The title is also shown in the sidebar. Try to keep your titles as short as possible. The title will automatically be converted to a file name, lower case, punctuation removed, with dashes between words. type For the basicDoc template, use page or omit type. If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Start each topic with a _* on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). If it's easy to include that detail in the short description, do so, but it's not required. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use single quotes to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when 'category' is 'http'). We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a link 'See attribute in docs' that links to the docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Tip To use Kubernetes integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). If it's easy to include that detail in the short description, do so, but it's not required. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use single quotes to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when 'category' is 'http'). We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a link 'See attribute in docs' that links to the docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: /docs-website/tree/develop/src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Our goal is to avoid adding redundant attributes entries, so you should first check to see if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). If it's easy to include that detail in the short description, do so, but it's not required. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use single quotes to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when 'category' is 'http'). We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a link 'See attribute in docs' that links to the docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Feel free to copy the text in this template to create your own GraphQL API tutorial, then fill in details that will help users learn how to use GraphQL in practical ways. Ideally the final version of your GraphQL doc will include: An introduction paragraph describing what problem or use case the users want to solve, or why the API can help them query to get this data Three to five query examples that show interesting data they can get from GraphQL Sample intro paragraph: You can use the New Relic GraphQL API to [ add key use cases here]. To construct these queries and see responses, you can use the New Relic GraphQL Explorer. This document explains some of the available functions to query [ data to be queried]. Example query #1 with GraphQL Add a description here for your example query. Tell users why they want to query this kind of data. Fill out the first block with your code, and the second with the data returned by the query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This query returns the following: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphQL Explorer to experiment with queries. Example query #2 with GraphQL Add a description here for your example query. Tell the customer why they want to query this kind of data.

      "body": "Explaining where to find UI pages and elements can be tricky. When done well, path descriptions can make navigating our UI easier for readers. Read on for tips on writing and formatting a UI path. Guidelines for writing good UI paths Our goal for UI paths is to make them easy to use and understand, preferably written in a conversational way. We're not concerned with absolute consistency. The examples here are guidelines and not firm rules. Guideline Description Use a concise, conversational format More often than not, we should keep UI paths short and conversational. For example: From the top navigation, select APM, select your application, and then click Distributed tracing. Consider path length The length of the path should influence your approach. A simple three-step navigation can be fully conversational. A multiple-step procedure may be an ordered list. And for something buried eight steps deep, consider using the x > y > z convention. Here's an example of a simple navigation: From one.newrelic.com, click the Query builder icon to start querying your data. Here's one for a multi-step procedure: To see details for a specific span: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Click Distributed tracing and select a trace from the trace index. Select a span to see its details. Here's one for a lengthier path, though this can usually be avoided by following our other guidelines: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a transaction trace) > Trace details: Avoid redundancy If there’s an existing doc or doc section that explains how to get to a specific UI element, section, or page, link to it. Here's an example that links to an existing doc: From the account dropdown, select Account settings, and then select Plan management. Here's one that links to an earlier section: To find details about the entity associated with a span: From a span’s details pane [ link to doc section above], select Attributes. Look for entity-related attributes, like entityId and entity.name. Orient the reader If something's hard to locate, you can use terms like top of the screen or left navigation. For example: From the top navigation, click APM and then choose your application. Use natural verbs Use natural, actionable verbs. Think about the user and the logic of the action and then read your steps out loud before deciding. Examples: click, select, choose. Use screenshots Screenshots can help ground the reader. For instance, if the UI contains a dashboard with multiple options, a screenshot can orient the reader with a common set of procedures. Exclude log-in instructions We should assume our readers are logged in. In other words, don’t include log in to New Relic instructions. Use your best judgment If you’re ever feeling stuck when writing a UI path, use your best judgment. The best way to format or word a UI path may depend on the path’s length and context. For example, whether or not to include a URL is up to you. If including Go to one.newrelic.com in a path description is cumbersome or unnatural, exclude it. If it helps orient the reader, feel free to include it. This same thinking applies towards most of our guidelines.",

Subdividing H2s Here's an example when you want a cleaner substitute for h3 tags when subdividing an h2 header: Installing the PHP agent manually. Unlike an h3, collapsers allow users to see all the options within a section at a glance without having to scroll. Create a collapser To create a collapser, you'll need to use our collapser code.

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the Docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "A well-chosen screenshot or image can greatly improve the readability and clarity of a doc. Too many images or an image that's tough to parse can really slow things down. Read on for more information about how to get an image added to one of our docs. Important If you're not part of the Docs team and you want to add an image to the docs site, create a GitHub issue. If you're a New Relic employee, contact @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Here are some things to keep in mind when you're creating an image: Make sure your image provides useful information at a glance. Include a caption with helpful context for the image. For screenshot captions, include the path in bold. For video captions, include the approximate running time. Add an image Our doc site images are stored in individual images directories at the root level of each taxonomy category. These images directories contain all the images used in the docs for that category. To add an image from scratch: Find the images directory for your doc. For example, if your docs lives in docs/style-guide/processes-procdures you would use the docs/style-guide/processes-procdures/images directory. If the images directory does not exist, create one in VScode or Finder. Place your image in the images directory. Give the image a descriptive file name: fso-ui-overview.png is much better than 123-go-dawgs.png. Follow the steps below to embed the image in a doc. Embed an image Use markdown to embed an image in a doc. The basic structure: ![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` Copy Here's a filled in example: ![An image showing an overview of the synthetics UI](./images/synthetics-ui-overview.png \"Synthetics UI overview\")` Copy Update an image To update an image: Delete the original image file in the corresponding images directory. Place the new image file in the same images directory. Ensure the image file has the same name as the original file. Write image captions Descriptive captions help the reader know why the image matters. If it's a screenshot, it's helpful to include the path in bold in addition to a description. For example: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information-dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. For more help with captions and other supporting text around images, see Guidelines for explaining images. Add an inline image If you'd like to use an inline image, you'll use something like this: From the Overview page, select your app's gear `![alt text](PATH_TO_IMAGE \"Image title text\")` icon. Copy If the image is being used as an icon, always describe it first. When you embed the icon image, follow the image with the word \"icon\" in the text. For example, \"select your app's gear icon.\" Add a fixed width, block level image Fixed width, block level images are similar in format to full column width images, except the original image width is smaller than the column width (800px) of a page. It's important that you edit the HTML like you would an inline image. This way the image will be rendered at 100% of the column width and also be responsive to smaller screen sizes. Use these images when a screenshot is a small part of the page with a width of less than 800px, but when it still needs a caption like a full width image. Here's an example of the HTML for a fixed width, block level image: <div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <img alt=\"ALT TEXT\" height=\"X\" src=\"IMG_URL\" title=\"FILENAME\" width=\"N\"> </div> <div class=\"dnd-legend-wrapper\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: Npx;\"> <div class=\"meta\"><p>CAPTION TEXT</p></div> </div> Copy Icons You can choose from a variety of icons to include in your docs: Feather icons (prefixed with 'fe-) Tip Feather icons replace our previous Font Awesome icons. New Relic icons (prefixed with nr-) Logos for third-party products (prefixed with logo-) Here are the two places you can look to see if we have the icon you need. If the icons are in either of these locations, you can use them in your documents. At the moment, these locations have separate, non-overlapping buckets of icons (this may change): Gatsby theme: This is a subset of Feather, New Relic, and product logo icons that are available across the developer and docs sites. Docs site Feather icons: These are the Feather icons available in the docs project but are not included in the Gatsby theme. Insert icons as tag attributes If your icon appears as an attribute inside another tag, prefix it with icon as in this example: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"AWS Lambda\" href=\"/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/get-started/monitoring-aws-lambda-serverless-monitoring\" icon=\"logo-aws\" > </LandingPageTile> Copy Insert inline icons If your icon appears inside running text, use the <Icon> component. Here are some examples: Feather: <Icon name=\"fe-database\" /> New Relic:<Icon name=\"nr-tdp\" /> Logos: <Icon name=\"logo-apple\" /> Install new Feather icons If you don't see the icon you want in either the Gatsby theme or in the docs site Feather icons, you can add a new icon to the Gatsby theme. Here's an example of adding a \"database\" icon: Tip Instead of following the instructions below, you can also ask developers to add the icon you want. Go to feathericons.com. Download the \"database\" feather icon by clicking on the icon itself. Once downloaded, open the SVG file in your text editor. Grab the \"guts\" of the SVG, which is everything in between the <svg> tags. For example, if the SVG looks like this: <svg><path m=\"1\"></path></svg>, then you'll grab only the <path m=\"1\"></path> portion. Open the list of feather icons at src/@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feather.js. Add an entry for database and assign the code from step #4 to it. This particular icon has multiple paths, so you'll want that <> wrapper around it like you'll see with other icons. Save that feather.js file. The fe- prefix gets automatically added. Once that icon is added, you can use it with the Icon component, for example, <Icon name=\"fe-database\" />.",

If you need to change a title or a redirect, create a GitHub issue or, if you're a New Relic employee, contact the Docs hero via the #documentation Slack channel.

To change the document's location in the left navigation, update the navigation configuration file. Change titles To change a document title, change the title being used in the title field in the frontmatter at the top of the doc. If you want to update the title in the left navigation, edit the yml file for the section that you're in. For example, the Style guide docs use /src/nav/style-guide.yml. Change anchor links Wherever possible, do not change the [#anchor_ids] of an H2 or collapser. There is no way to redirect from a deleted anchor to its new value. Even if the anchor id is outdated, this does not affect the majority of users who pay no attention to URLs.

For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: New Relic APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents. Here's an example: <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy Code sample Here's a sample landing page you could modify to suit your needs: --- title: INSERT_YOUR_TITLE_HERE type: landingPage --- <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Aliquam auctor mattis nisl ut iaculis. * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Suspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod, a consectetur tortor vulputate. </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) to lectus diam, ornare vitae dui suscipit, laoreet ultrices lacus. * Mauris tempor massa ac augue mattis, nec pharetra quam mollis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) rhoncus tortor vitae libero laoreet feugiat. * Donec dui elit, fermentum vel faucibus sed, rhoncus in felis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) uspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod. * Pellentesque finibus magna vitae hendrerit gravida [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique. * Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Quisque hendrerit, dolor sed sodales aliquet. * Vestibulum varius lectus ac velit euismod [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> </LandingPageTileGrid> <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain to be used for your SCIM-provisioned users. Under Source of users, enable SCIM. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your OneLogin applications: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",
