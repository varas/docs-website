      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two sub-accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. For more on product-specific pricing: see the APM pricing and Infrastructure pricing pages. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two subaccounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Import user groups from an identity provider using AUM For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next?

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type.

Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Import user groups from an identity provider using AUM For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. Use the Organization and access UI to enable SCIM and configure SAML SSO. Configure your identity provider using one of our relevant guides:Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of those, we also have a SCIM API. Note that your users are created in New Relic as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\").

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI.

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add Applications page, enter \"New Relic by Organization\" and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application Visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 2. Configure provisioning Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API Integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. From the authentication domain UI, get the SCIM bearer token and input it in the New Relic SCIM/SSO app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API Credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create Users, Update User Attributes, and Deactivate Users sections. Click Save. Step 3. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application provisioning configuration and the New Relic side SSO configuration is finished, you can assign users to the application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs on the the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push Groups tab. Assignments tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to Groups. From the Assign ... to Groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and Go Back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, click on Push Groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push Groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No Match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create Group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & Add Another and repeat the steps to add a group. Step 4. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push Groups tab. From the Push Groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. After adding users, you'll want to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. To learn how to do this, see Manage users.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: You can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it’s under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page.

As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) will not receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users for New Relic accounts with SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Admin user's API keys for all users that go into a pending state will be deleted. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization.

Most of the information you will need is visible in your New Relic account on the Single Sign On page, such as: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

With Partner accounts, authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. For accounts where the partnership supports SSO, users may access their New Relic UI without reauthenticating. These Partner accounts could use SAML SSO as an alternative secure method to sign in to the New Relic site. Other Partner accounts, including Heroku, AppDirect, and Microsoft Azure, do not permit direct login to New Relic. In this situation, SAML integration from the partner's site is not supported by the partner SSO. If you have questions, contact your partner representative at New Relic. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Example Your account structure and settings affect whether SAML is available and how it applies to your accounts. This example shows the hierarchy for New Relic Partner accounts with master accounts and sub-accounts. Here is an example of how accounts and sub-accounts inherit the SAML SSO configuration. Account level SAML SSO configuration Partnership The partnership level allows you to control whether accounts under the partnership can have SAML enabled. The partnership account's Owner has certain administrative functions, but a SAML configuration on this account is not inherited by other accounts in the partnership. Master accounts Master accounts have a direct, hierarchical relationship to one or more sub-accounts. Typically the SAML configuration on a master account is inherited automatically by all of its sub-accounts. Sub-accounts Sub-accounts inherit their SAML SSO configuration from their master account when the master account has SAML configured. If the master account does not have SAML configured, each sub-account may have its own configuration. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts.",

Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used. Requirements Requirements include: These docs apply for managing users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Owner user role required Providers supported by New Relic For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible in your New Relic account on the Single Sign On page, such as: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

With Partner accounts, authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. For accounts where the partnership supports SSO, users may access their New Relic UI without reauthenticating. These Partner accounts could use SAML SSO as an alternative secure method to sign in to the New Relic site. Other Partner accounts, including Heroku, AppDirect, and Microsoft Azure, do not permit direct login to New Relic. In this situation, SAML integration from the partner's site is not supported by the partner SSO. If you have questions, contact your partner representative at New Relic. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Example Your account structure and settings affect whether SAML is available and how it applies to your accounts. This example shows the hierarchy for New Relic Partner accounts with master accounts and sub-accounts. Here is an example of how accounts and sub-accounts inherit the SAML SSO configuration. Account level SAML SSO configuration Partnership The partnership level allows you to control whether accounts under the partnership can have SAML enabled. The partnership account's Owner has certain administrative functions, but a SAML configuration on this account is not inherited by other accounts in the partnership. Master accounts Master accounts have a direct, hierarchical relationship to one or more sub-accounts. Typically the SAML configuration on a master account is inherited automatically by all of its sub-accounts. Sub-accounts Sub-accounts inherit their SAML SSO configuration from their master account when the master account has SAML configured. If the master account does not have SAML configured, each sub-account may have its own configuration. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts.",

Most of the information you will need is visible in your New Relic account on the Single Sign On page, such as: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications.

If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

Reduce data ingest If you want to stop reporting some data to New Relic without downgrading or cancelling, you can configure our tools to send less data. For how to manage data ingest, see Manage your data. To uninstall agents or integrations, here are some recommended procedures: Remove APM, browser, and mobile apps Remove infrastructure agent For how to disable other New Relic tools, see their specific docs. You can search New Relic integrations here. Downgrade organization Options for downgrading your New Relic organization will differ depending on your pricing edition: Pro or Enterprise edition downgrade To downgrade your Pro or Enterprise organization, contact your New Relic account representative. Standard edition downgrade Options for downgrading for Standard edition: If you're being billed and want to downgrade: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Manage your plan, and then click Downgrade account. Once you are downgraded, you’ll still be able to access New Relic via the login page. If you're not being billed and haven't input your credit card, you don’t need to downgrade and can continue using New Relic at a free level. Cancel organization If you've accidentally signed up for New Relic and want to delete that account, see Delete simple organization.

      "body": "If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create a more complex account structure with multiple accounts in one organization. Requirements How you manage accounts and users differs based on which account/user model your organization is on. To learn more about the account/user structures, see User models. The major differences are: New Relic One user model: The Standard edition includes only one account per organization, and higher editions allow you to have multiple accounts. To add more accounts to your organization, currently you must be helped by a New Relic representative. To add users to accounts, see Manage users. Original user model: You can create your own sub-accounts. Keep reading to learn how this account structure works. Master and sub-account hierarchy For organizations with multiple accounts, each sub-account is attached to a single master account and can have multiple apps reporting to it. The master account may also have applications reporting to it, but not all data sent from sub-account applications rolls-up into the master account data. To learn how to switch between accounts in the UI, see Account access. To understand how sub-accounts and master accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you have a partnership account structure, see Partnership accounts. Master accounts can have their own apps reporting data. However, an app reporting to a sub-account may not report data to a master account. License keys for sub-accounts In a New Relic organization, your main New Relic account serves as the master account with its own license key. Each sub-account has their own individual license keys (and their own API keys). Each application can use only one license key, so each application can report to only one account. Create sub-accounts To add accounts to your New Relic organization, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add an account depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: work with your New Relic account representative. Original user model: Follow these instructions: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From Sub-accounts, select Add account. Type the sub-account name, then select Add this account. Continue with the procedures to add users to sub-accounts. Add users to sub-accounts To have a New Relic organization with more than one account, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add users to a sub-account in your organization depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: you must create an access grant that gives users access to a specific account. To learn more, see User management concepts. Original user model: In general, permissions for a user on a master account are automatically inherited for that user on sub-accounts. To add users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From the master account's Sub-accounts list, select the sub-account's link. From the sub-account's Active users section, select Add user, fill in the user's email, name, role, and title as appropriate, and then select Add this user. Optional: Change the Owner or Admin roles for the sub-account as appropriate. Set up accounts with SAML SSO How to set up SAML SSO will depend on which user model your users are on: Original user model: If you set up SAML SSO at the master account level, your sub-account users will also be able to sign in using SSO. If you don't set SAML SSO at the master level, you can set it at the sub-account level. However, do not set SAML SSO at both levels. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts. New Relic One user model: see SAML SSO. Update sub-account applications Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition. Your must be on our original user model (if you're on our New Relic One user model, you need assistance from New Relic). Must be Owner or Admin. When you change the app's config file to move it from one account to another, New Relic treats it as a new app in the new sub-account. New Relic does not move any historical data for the app. To install a new app for your sub-account: Make sure you have selected the master account: From the account dropdown, select Switch account > (master account). Follow standard procedures to install new applications. OR Change the license key in the existing application's configuration file to move it to another sub-account.",

You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created.

Potential impacts include: Your user type (basic user or full user). Your assigned roles. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which user model you're on. Account access If you're logged in to New Relic and don't see the account or data you expect to see, some causes and solutions include: If your organization has multiple accounts, there's an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages. Check to see if you can use that to switch accounts. You may have more than one login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI tells you if you have multiple logins and gives you an option for seeing all accounts associated with that email. If you're having trouble accessing an older account, see this Explorers Hub post about multiple account access. It's possible an admin user in your organization changed your permissions for an account.

      "body": "If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create a more complex account structure with multiple accounts in one organization. Requirements How you manage accounts and users differs based on which account/user model your organization is on. To learn more about the account/user structures, see User models. The major differences are: New Relic One user model: The Standard edition includes only one account per organization, and higher editions allow you to have multiple accounts. To add more accounts to your organization, currently you must be helped by a New Relic representative. To add users to accounts, see Manage users. Original user model: You can create your own sub-accounts. Keep reading to learn how this account structure works. Master and sub-account hierarchy For organizations with multiple accounts, each sub-account is attached to a single master account and can have multiple apps reporting to it. The master account may also have applications reporting to it, but not all data sent from sub-account applications rolls-up into the master account data. To learn how to switch between accounts in the UI, see Account access. To understand how sub-accounts and master accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you have a partnership account structure, see Partnership accounts. Master accounts can have their own apps reporting data. However, an app reporting to a sub-account may not report data to a master account. License keys for sub-accounts In a New Relic organization, your main New Relic account serves as the master account with its own license key. Each sub-account has their own individual license keys (and their own API keys). Each application can use only one license key, so each application can report to only one account. Create sub-accounts To add accounts to your New Relic organization, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add an account depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: work with your New Relic account representative. Original user model: Follow these instructions: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From Sub-accounts, select Add account. Type the sub-account name, then select Add this account. Continue with the procedures to add users to sub-accounts. Add users to sub-accounts To have a New Relic organization with more than one account, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add users to a sub-account in your organization depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: you must create an access grant that gives users access to a specific account. To learn more, see User management concepts. Original user model: In general, permissions for a user on a master account are automatically inherited for that user on sub-accounts. To add users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From the master account's Sub-accounts list, select the sub-account's link. From the sub-account's Active users section, select Add user, fill in the user's email, name, role, and title as appropriate, and then select Add this user. Optional: Change the Owner or Admin roles for the sub-account as appropriate. Set up accounts with SAML SSO How to set up SAML SSO will depend on which user model your users are on: Original user model: If you set up SAML SSO at the master account level, your sub-account users will also be able to sign in using SSO. If you don't set SAML SSO at the master level, you can set it at the sub-account level. However, do not set SAML SSO at both levels. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts. New Relic One user model: see SAML SSO. Update sub-account applications Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition. Your must be on our original user model (if you're on our New Relic One user model, you need assistance from New Relic). Must be Owner or Admin. When you change the app's config file to move it from one account to another, New Relic treats it as a new app in the new sub-account. New Relic does not move any historical data for the app. To install a new app for your sub-account: Make sure you have selected the master account: From the account dropdown, select Switch account > (master account). Follow standard procedures to install new applications. OR Change the license key in the existing application's configuration file to move it to another sub-account.",

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a UI for understanding your New Relic usage and managing your data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. But to get more detail, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should set the Evaluation offset value to 60 minutes or your conditions may not trigger. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple sub-accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_SUB-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month).

From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO).

Requirements Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements: This tutorial is for managing users on our New Relic One user model. Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs: Where to find user management features in the UI Important user management concepts This tutorial will walk you through how to: View available accounts How to grant groups access to roles and accounts How to create custom roles How to add users to groups View available accounts Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant groups access to roles and accounts Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization. Tip Note that you can also import users from your identity provider. To view existing group access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. To grant a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing group or a new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about these concepts, see User management concepts. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under Scope, select Organization and choose the Authentication domain manager role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see Standard roles. (Note that these users must also have an account-scoped role. Without that, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. Some important tips to understand when managing groups: If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group. Create custom role When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our default standard roles that have default capabilities, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Note that there are some hidden capabilities that are not available for adding to a custom role. For details, see Capabilities. To learn more about how roles and groups relate, see User management concepts. Add users If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. To view or manage users: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user.

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-model organizations that meet requirements can use a migration wizard to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Before using the user migration wizard, please review the guidelines below. The wizard is aimed at migrating users for fairly simple New Relic organizations. We'll continue to add to the user migration features so that it works better for more complex organizations. Requirements and guidelines: You must have the Owner role to start using the user migration wizard. If your organization has more than 20 accounts, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If your organization has a fairly complex master/sub-account structure, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. If you frequently add sub-accounts to your organization, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Currently, with the new model, you must get New Relic assistance to add sub-accounts. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) are currently applied for an entire organization and can't be assigned at the account level. If you require account-level user management role assignment, we recommend not using the wizard. If you don't meet these requirements but still want to migrate your users in order to take advantage of the new model benefits, contact your New Relic account representative. Understand basic user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users complete access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with multiple accounts, a common configuration would include a group with the Organization manager role, a group with the Authentication domain manager, a group with the Billing user at the master account level, and then configuring product admins, users, and all other roles at the sub-account level, depending on organization preferences. Customers with smaller or flatter organizations that require transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration may be around five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). The two sections are described in more detail: Managing users For managing users, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider (like Okta, OneLogin, and Azure AD) to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. You can continue the migration workflow and skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps below. Note about identity provider apps Note that some identity providers (Okta, Azure, and OneLogin) have New Relic apps for both the original account/user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original account/user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs. full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role.

SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type.

Requirements Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements: This tutorial is for managing users on our New Relic One user model. Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs: Where to find user management features in the UI Important user management concepts This tutorial will walk you through how to: View available accounts How to grant groups access to roles and accounts How to create custom roles How to add users to groups View available accounts Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant groups access to roles and accounts Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization. Tip Note that you can also import users from your identity provider. To view existing group access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. To grant a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing group or a new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about these concepts, see User management concepts. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under Scope, select Organization and choose the Authentication domain manager role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see Standard roles. (Note that these users must also have an account-scoped role. Without that, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. Some important tips to understand when managing groups: If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group. Create custom role When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our default standard roles that have default capabilities, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Note that there are some hidden capabilities that are not available for adding to a custom role. For details, see Capabilities. To learn more about how roles and groups relate, see User management concepts. Add users If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. To view or manage users: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access.

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-model organizations that meet requirements can use a migration wizard to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Before using the user migration wizard, please review the guidelines below. The wizard is aimed at migrating users for fairly simple New Relic organizations. We'll continue to add to the user migration features so that it works better for more complex organizations. Requirements and guidelines: You must have the Owner role to start using the user migration wizard. If your organization has more than 20 accounts, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If your organization has a fairly complex master/sub-account structure, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. If you frequently add sub-accounts to your organization, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Currently, with the new model, you must get New Relic assistance to add sub-accounts. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) are currently applied for an entire organization and can't be assigned at the account level. If you require account-level user management role assignment, we recommend not using the wizard. If you don't meet these requirements but still want to migrate your users in order to take advantage of the new model benefits, contact your New Relic account representative. Understand basic user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users complete access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with multiple accounts, a common configuration would include a group with the Organization manager role, a group with the Authentication domain manager, a group with the Billing user at the master account level, and then configuring product admins, users, and all other roles at the sub-account level, depending on organization preferences. Customers with smaller or flatter organizations that require transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration may be around five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). The two sections are described in more detail: Managing users For managing users, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider (like Okta, OneLogin, and Azure AD) to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. You can continue the migration workflow and skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps below. Note about identity provider apps Note that some identity providers (Okta, Azure, and OneLogin) have New Relic apps for both the original account/user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original account/user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic vs. full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used.

This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, in New Relic One, click your user name, select Manage your data, and then select Data retention. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking the Edit retention button. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each New Relic APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in New Relic APM, Mobile, and Browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Infrastructure accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, a New Relic Infrastructure account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours. All Infrastructure events have a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. For more information, see query examples. Usage calculation Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running Infrastructure (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. If your usage is fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Infrastructure usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns displayed depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Infrastructure-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Infrastructure attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by Infrastructure. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Infrastructure. Attribute Description agentHostname ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating infrastructureHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The usage reporting system will always use the agent-reported hostname to uniquely identify the host for the Infrastructure product, but will also record the cloudInstanceId, if present, for informational purposes. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for infrastructureBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. infrastructureAgentVersion Version of the Infrastructure agent running on the host reporting this usage. If multiple agents are reporting from the same host, the version from the first agent seen in a given hour will be used. infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as reported by the cloud provider, used to calculate infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. infrastructureBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU billing purposes. Calculated as: number of processors multiplied by memory in GiB. infrastructureHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given host. When a host is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. infrastructureComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as: infrastructureHoursUsed multiplied by infrastructureBillingInstanceSize. For more about compute unit calculation, see CU pricing. infrastructureComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an agent and operating system combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData True if the Infrastructure agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value Infrastructure when querying for Infrastructure usage data. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. This value is Host for Infrastructure. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Infrastructure subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. For general information about how to use NRQL queries to get focused usage data, see Intro to usage data. Compute units for last month This query produces a count of the CUs used over the last month: SELECT sum(infrastructureComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Detailed host report (reproducing old usage report) This query reproduces as closely as possible the report you would have gotten by downloading the CSV from the previously available Infrastructure subscription usage UI: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID',agentHostname,cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type',infrastructureBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size',infrastructureHoursUsed AS 'Hours used',infrastructureComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', infrastructureCloudDerivedMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureCloudDerivedProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureAgentMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM',infrastructureAgentProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors',infrastructureComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule',missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped,cloudZone,cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='Infrastructure' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 1000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Detailed host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last day of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to 1000 NRQL limits the results to 1000. If you have more than 1000 hosts and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE agentHostname LIKE ... to divide the data into groups). Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: infrastructureComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are now boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the infrastructureComputeUnitRule attribute. Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this doc explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have host-based pricing (not CU-based pricing). This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance that existed during the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance ran during the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations For host-based APM pricing, monthly billable usage is determined by the number of equivalent hosts used during that month. An equivalent host is defined as: 750 hours (standardized number of monthly hours) of connection to New Relic by a host or multiple hosts. For more on this calculation, see host-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. See the Avg daily equivalent hosts for an account or grouping of accounts. The UI is meant to estimate your host usage but, especially for cloud environments, your usage may go up or down over time. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a master account or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily equivalent hosts Average equivalent hosts for that day. Calculated as the total number of hours reported for all unique hosts in a day, divided by 24. For more on how this is calculated, see Host-based pricing. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (host-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by host-based APM accounts (not CU-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. When calculating monthly APM host usage, the calculation for equivalent hosts for a month assumes that a standard month has 750 hours: ` apmHoursUsed / 750 ` . apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Always use the value APM when querying for APM CU usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage data can be analyzed in several ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Usage for last month This query uses New Relic’s standard number of hours per month (750) for the purpose of calculating APM equivalent hosts over the last month. SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed)/750 AS 'Equivalent hosts' FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Usage per host per application New Relic records usage per application instance, not strictly per application. This query gives an approximation of the usage for a given application on a given host. If unique application instances run sequentially on a host within a given day, this query could return an underestimate (this would be likely, for example, in a container environment). SELECT max(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName,hostId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Instance-hours per application This query measures the total number of hours used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmHoursUsed) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, master, sub-accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have seen in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with other attributes. It no longer is used to describe whether the agent needs to be updated. Legacy host usage report (application listing) This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Use of Docker and other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of host-based usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and sub-accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the master account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. masterAccountName Name of the master account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a master account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a master account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a master account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). subAccountName Name of the sub-account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a sub-account (not a master account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage.

      "body": "New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements This doc is for users on our original user model. If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for sub-accounts By default, sub-accounts inherit the same session configuration as their master account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two sub-accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. For more on product-specific pricing: see the APM pricing and Infrastructure pricing pages. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two subaccounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Sub-accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic. View or change current subscription To view or change your current subscription options: From the account dropdown, select Upgrade subscription/Change subscription. OR From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Subscription. Options include: Upgrade or downgrade your pricing and subscription levels Cancel your subscription or delete your account Change your account's tax location for billing purposes If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your subscription usage information: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Usage. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Billing. Billing settings include: Account contact information, including name, organization, address, phone, email, purchase order number, etc. Billing history, including invoices and receipts Credit card or other payment method",

If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

Account access If you're logged in to New Relic and don't see the account or data you expect to see, some causes and solutions include: If your organization has multiple accounts, there's an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages. Check to see if you can use that to switch accounts. You may have more than one login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI tells you if you have multiple logins and gives you an option for seeing all accounts associated with that email.

If you are trying to create a new account and receive a message that your email account already exists, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Email link does not redirect to the password reset page. If you have used your password reset link but are not redirected to the password reset page, troubleshoot the following: Your password reset link has expired. You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure \"authentication domains,\" which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by specific settings, like how they are provisioned (added to New Relic), how they are authenticated (logged in), and more. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their username and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed automatically from an identity provider (like Okta or Azure AD) Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added within a specific authentication domain. Users in one authentication domain are not available for management when in another domain. Typically organizations will have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods tied to their identity provider. Configurable elements of an authentication domain include: Source of users (managed manually via the UI or managed automatically via identity provider) Authentication method (using manual username/password login or using SSO). Session management (how long a user can stay logged in, how long a browser session can be idle) Configure authentication domain via UI If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: this means that your users are added manually to New Relic. SCIM: enabling SCIM lets you use our automated user management (AUM) to import/manage users from your identity provider. Please read requirements and impacts before enabling. Authentication The authentication method is the method by which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. Once a user authenticates with New Relic, they have access to any account they've been granted permissions for. There are two authentication options: Username/password: your users log in via standard username and password. SAML SSO: your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. Tip How users authenticate to New Relic is independent of how they're added (manually or SCIM). SCIM-added users require SAML SSO but manually-added users may or may not use SAML SSO. Configure SAML SSO Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. If you're using Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, your first step is to get and enable the New Relic integration for that service. To do this, follow the \"Add SCIM/SSO application\" instructions in these docs and then return here for more instructions: Azure | Okta | OneLogin. If you're using a custom SAML 2.0 integration, note that when configuring SAML manually, we require the option for signed SAML assertions to be enabled. Next, you'll enable SAML SSO from New Relic's authentication domain UI: Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. Under Provided by New Relic, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. Under Provided by you, set the source of SAML metadata with a URL pointing to your SAML metadata (recommended). This URL is supplied by your identity provider and should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. Tip Alternatively, set the source of SAML metadata by selecting Upload a certificate and selecting Choose file. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. A certificate should only be uploaded if your identity provider does not support dynamic configuration. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, enter the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. Next, you'll need to give your users access to New Relic. This usually takes the form of creating groups and adding users to groups and accounts. Other settings In the authentication domain UI, you can control several other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a users' session expires. User access requests: This controls how basic users become full users. You can either allow basic users to self-upgrade or you can require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). Allowing users to self-upgrade allows them to quickly respond to issues. If Require review is set, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. (Note that upgrade works differently for users on our original user model.)",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. If you've unintentionally signed up for New Relic and want to delete your entire account, see Delete organization. Create new groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which user model you're on? See Overview of pricing and users. With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: You can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it’s under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: You can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Master and sub-accounts When it comes to master and sub-accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a master account is inherited by all sub-accounts, unless a sub-account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your master and sub-accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving sub-accounts If a sub-account is moved to another master, it will adopt the retention settings of the new master account it’s under. However, if the sub-account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its master account. Copy retention values from one sub-account to other sub-accounts From within a sub-account, select Copy retentions and use that sub-account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target sub-accounts. Note: Source and destination sub-accounts must all be under the same master account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a sub-account, that sub-account will adopt the current retention value of its master account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a master account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing sub-account rules to other sub-accounts You can specify a sub-account to be the template or source account, and have other destination sub-accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source sub-account. Note: all sub-accounts must be within the same master account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model.

      "body": "New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements This doc is for users on our original user model. If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for sub-accounts By default, sub-accounts inherit the same session configuration as their master account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two sub-accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. For more on product-specific pricing: see the APM pricing and Infrastructure pricing pages. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a master account with two subaccounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the master account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Sub-accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model, which controls how you manage users and account structure. If you have a New Relic organization created after July 30, 2020, you're on our newer pricing plan and newer user model. But for older customers, your pricing plan and user model are not necessarily related (for example, you may have switched to our newer pricing plan and still have users on our original user model). Keep reading to learn about: Our original and new pricing plans Our original and new account/user models How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other How to switch to the new models Pricing plan changes explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on which Full Stack Observability edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise) you're on, the GBs of data ingested, and the count of billable \"full users.\" All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan. Some older organizations are able to transition to this pricing. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (e.g., APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan using UI To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user model changes explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. We have two user models: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model are managed differently than are users on the original user model. There's no longer an account \"owner\" role, which was a key aspect of our original user model. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model are managed differently than are users on the newer model. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Learn about migrating your users to be on the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alert notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models. How pricing and user model relate As explained in the pricing and user model overview, your pricing plan and user model aren't necessarily related. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Users on original user model Users on New Relic One user model Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. See original pricing plan docs. For original pricing accounts, your users are on the original user model, unless they were added via automated user management. See original user docs. For original pricing accounts, users added with automated user management (users imported from your identity provider) are on the New Relic One user model. Upon switching to New Relic One pricing, you'll have new roles available. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan if it was created on or after July 30 2020 or it's an older organization but has transitioned to New Relic One pricing. See New Relic One pricing docs. If your organization has transitioned to New Relic One pricing, your users are on our original user model (unless they were added via automated user management). These users are now also categorized by user type (full vs basic). See original user docs. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on this user model. See New Relic One user docs.",

      "body": "New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements This doc is for users on our original user model. If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for sub-accounts By default, sub-accounts inherit the same session configuration as their master account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) will not receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users for New Relic accounts with SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Admin user's API keys for all users that go into a pending state will be deleted. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization.

Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible in your New Relic account on the Single Sign On page, such as: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Python agent release notes. Update with Python package index (PyPi) The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic. To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions: Python package Installation procedures pip To update the newrelic package directly from PyPi, run: pip install --upgrade newrelic Copy If you have New Relic in your requirements.txt file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt Copy easy_install To update using easy_install, run: easy_install --upgrade newrelic Copy Tip We recommend using pip rather than using easy_install, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. buildout Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Download package manually To manually download the New Relic Python package: Remove the current New Relic package. Download the new package, then follow the Python agent installation procedures. Tip We recommend using pip rather than using manual installation, because pip will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software. Python agent versions not supported End of life notification: As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than 2.42.0. These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector. Update unsupported agent versions Important If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality. Migration Comments 4.2.0.100 and higher Release notes: Python agent 4.2.0.100 Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the Python agent config file. 4.0.0.99 Release notes: Python agent 4.0.0.99 Previously deprecated APIs removed: Transaction.add_user_attribute (use Transaction.add_custom_parameter) Transaction.add_user_attributes (use Transaction.add_custom_parameters) wrap_callable (use FunctionWrapper) Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3: Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. Recommendation: Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3: These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. 3.0.0.89 Release notes: Python agent 3.0.0.89 Previously deprecated APIs removed: transaction (use current_transaction) name_transaction (use set_transaction_name) Application.record_metric (use Application.record_custom_metric) Application.record_metrics (use Application.record_custom_metrics) Transaction.record_metric (use Transaction.record_custom_metric) Transaction.name_transaction (use Transaction.set_transaction_name) Deprecated APIs: Transaction.add_user_attribute has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameter. Transaction.add_user_attribute will be removed in a future release. Transaction.add_user_attributes has been deprecated in favor of Transaction.add_custom_parameters. Transaction.add_user_attributes will be removed in a future release. wrap_callable has been deprecated in favor of FunctionWrapper. wrap_callable will be removed in a future release. data-source admin command: The platform API (used by newrelic-admin data-source) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API. 2.104.0.86 Release notes: Python agent 2.104.0.86 SSL: Disabling SSL connections has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed. 2.56.0.42 Release notes: Python agent 2.56.0.42 Deprecated config settings: Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are capture_params and ignored_params. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new attributes.include and attributes.exclude settings. 2.10.0.8 Release notes: Python agent 2.10.0.8 Deprecated API: Do not use the agent API function add_user_attribute(), which is now deprecated. Instead, use the add_custom_parameter() function. Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the browser_monitoring.capture_attributes agent configuration setting. At or below 2.0.0 Proxy settings: Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether SSL is disabled or enabled. If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility. Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set proxy_scheme, this may result in a failure. 1.11.0.55 Release notes: Python agent 1.11.0.55 Thread profiling for WSGI servers: We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as gevent or eventlet. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data. 1.0.3.138 Release notes: Python agent 1.0.3.138 Attributes from WSGI requests: Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_REFERER, and HTTP_USER_AGENT now appear in the UI under the Request environment category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under Custom parameters.",

      "body": "Our Python agent lets you change the default agent behavior agent using configuration options. The only required Python agent configuration setting is the license key. The license key identifies the account where the agent reports application data. Depending on how you are hosting your application, the license key can be provided via a configuration file or an environment variable. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Python agent is via the configuration file, which is generated as part of the standard install process. It is also possible to set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI or by using environment variables. You can also specify some settings on a per-request basis by passing settings with the WSGI request environ dictionary. The Python agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: With the Python agent, per-request options override server-side config. If enabled, server-side config overrides all corresponding values in the agent config file, even if the server-side values are left blank. The agent config file overrides environment variables. Environment variables override the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file Typically you configure your Python agent from a local configuration file on the agent's host system. Supply the path to the config file at startup using one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the path to the config file as the first argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable. If you use the newrelic-admin wrapper script, you must use the environment variable because the wrapper script calls the agent automatically. The configuration file uses a structure similar to Microsoft Windows .ini files. For more information, see the Python ConfigParser module's file format documentation. Tip A sample configuration file is included with the Python agent as newrelic/newrelic.ini. You can also generate one from the newrelic-admin script using the generate-config command, or download a copy from our download repo. Server-side configuration Tip Owner or Admins Server-side configuration allows you to configure certain settings in the New Relic One UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. Important If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the config file that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty string and does not use the agent config file. Environment variables Environment variables allow you to override the defaults for certain core settings. If the equivalent setting is explicitly listed in the agent config file, the config file settings take precedence over the environment variable. Where available, environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. For simple configurations, you can use the environment variables in conjunction with server-side configuration and avoid the agent config file altogether. This is the default setup with Heroku, where installing the New Relic add-on automatically populates the necessary environment variables. Environment variable Configuration setting NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY license_key NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME app_name NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE monitor_mode NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE developer_mode NEW_RELIC_LOG log_file NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL log_level NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY high_security NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME proxy_scheme NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST proxy_host NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT proxy_port NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER proxy_user NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS proxy_pass NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG audit_log_file NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT startup_timeout NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT shutdown_timeout NEW_RELIC_LABELS labels NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME process_host.display_name NEW_RELIC_API_KEY api_key NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH ca_bundle_path NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED distributed_tracing.enabled NEW_RELIC_FEATURE_FLAG feature_flag Per-request configuration For certain WSGI servers, you can override the app name and capture attributes settings on a per-request basis. This is possible with WSGI servers where you can define additional key/value pairs that are passed into the per-request WSGI environ dictionary. Set these values with the strings on, off, true, false, 1 and 0. If set from a configuration mechanism implemented using Python code, Python objects evaluating to True or False will also be accepted. Example: Apache/mod_wsgi app name In the Apache/mod_wsgi server, you can use the SetEnv directive to override config settings (optionally inside a Location or Directory block). For example, you could override the app name for a complete virtual host, or for a subset of URLs handled by the WSGI application for that virtual host. In addition to being able to override certain agent configuration settings, you can set other per-request configuration settings with their WSGI environment key: newrelic.set_background_task If set to true, this web transaction will instead be reported as a non-web transaction. newrelic.ignore_transaction If set to true, this web transaction will not be reported. newrelic.suppress_apdex_metric If set to true, no Apdex metric will be generated for this web transaction. newrelic.suppress_transaction_trace If set to true, this web transaction cannot be recorded in a transaction trace. newrelic.disable_browser_autorum If set to true, this disables automatic insertion of the JavaScript header/footer for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Only applicable if auto-insertion is available for your web framework. Important Using a WSGI middleware to set these values will not work where the Python agent's own WSGI application wrapper was applied at an outer scope. In these cases you must make calls to the agent API to achieve the same outcome. Multiple environment configuration The agent reads its primary configuration from an agent config section called newrelic. You can provide overrides for specific deployment environments (for example, Development, Staging, Production) in additional sections. Preface these sections with [newrelic:environment], where environment is replaced with the name of your environment. To specify that the agent should use an environment-based configuration, use one of these methods: When you call newrelic.agent.initialize(), provide the environment name as the second argument. OR Set the NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to the environment name. If no environment is specified, the agent will use the default settings as specified in the newrelic agent config section. The basic structure of the configuration file is: [newrelic] ... default settings [newrelic:development] ... override settings [newrelic:staging] ... override settings [newrelic:production] ... override settings Copy General configuration settings These settings are available in the agent configuration file. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Specifies the license key of your New Relic account. This key associates your app's metrics with your New Relic account. app_name (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Type String Default Python Application Set in Per-request option, config file, environment variable Per-request option newrelic.app_name Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic One UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon ;. Do not put a space before the semicolon, which causes the Python config parser to interpret the name as an embedded comment. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent collects performance data about your app and reports this data to our data collector. developer_mode Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DEVELOPER_MODE When true, the agent will instrument your web app, but will not send any actual data. In this offline mode, you will not be billed for an active agent. Use developer mode to test new versions of the agent, or test the agent against third-party packages in a developer environment. Offline mode is not a way of running the APM locally, because the metrics the agent collects are not reported anywhere. log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Sets the name of a log file, which is useful for debugging issues with the agent. This is not set by default, since the agent does not know your web app process's parent user or what directories that process has permission to write to. For detailed information, see Python agent logging. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct, and that the user that your web application runs as can write to the file. Tip Use an absolute path unless you are sure what the working directory of your application will be at startup. If you can't write out a log file, you can also use stderr and output to standard error output. This would normally result in output appearing in your web server log. log_level Type String Default info Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages, if you've set the log file location. This log_level will not affect the Python logging module log level. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are critical, error, warning, info, and debug. To report agent issues, the most useful setting is debug. However, debug generates a lot of information very quickly, so do not keep the agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce your problem. high_security Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to us. Enabling high security mode means that request parameters are not collected, and you cannot send raw SQL. To activate high security mode, set it to true in the local .ini configuration file and activate it in the Account Settings in the UI. For more information, see High security. proxy_scheme, proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass Type Strings Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variables NEW_RELIC_PROXY_SCHEME NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS By default, the Python agent attempts to directly connect to our servers. If there is a firewall between your host and the our collector that requires you to use an HTTP proxy, set proxy_host and proxy_port to the required values for your HTTP proxy. If proxy authentication is implemented by the HTTP proxy, also set proxy_user and proxy_pass. The proxy_scheme setting dictates what protocol scheme is used to talk to the HTTP proxy. When set to http, the agent uses a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end-to-end encryption. Instead of setting the proxy_scheme, proxy_host and proxy_port settings, you can also set the proxy_host setting to a valid URI for the proxy. Include the scheme, host, and port; for example, http://proxy-host:8000. This also works if you set the details of the HTTP proxy with the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST environment variable. Tip Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the proxy_scheme setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending whether ssl is disabled or enabled. If you are upgrading from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include proxy_scheme, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the ssl setting for backwards compatibility. As proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme, not setting proxy_scheme may result in a failure. audit_log_file Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG Sets the name of the audit log file. If set, the agent logs details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the collector. This allows you to evaluate the security of the Python agent. Use an absolute path unless you are sure what your app's working directory will be at startup. Whatever you set this to, ensure the permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. Also ensure your web app's parent user can write to the file. Caution Do not use audit logging on an ongoing basis, especially in a production environment. Because the agent does not truncate or rotate the log file, the log file can grow very quickly. labels (tags) Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS Adds tags. Specify name:value separated by a colon :, and separate additional tags with semicolons ;. Two tags Server:One;Data Center:Primary Copy process_host.display_name Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. api_key Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_KEY Sets the api_key to be used with newrelic-admin record-deploy. ca_bundle_path Type String Default (none) Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 4.2.0 and newer. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T We'll record transaction traces when they exceed this threshold. The format is a number of seconds (decimal points allowed). See our glossary entry for apdex_t Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs that provide information for transaction traces, traced errors, browser monitoring, and transaction events. In addition to configuring attributes for all four destinations with the general attribute settings below, they can also be configured on a per-destination basis. For more information, see Python agent attributes, Enabling and disabling attributes, and Attribute examples. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes. attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled, attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to us. Keys in the list should be space-separated as shown below: key1 key2 key3 Copy Rules for attributes can be found on the agent attributes page. Transaction tracer configuration Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. The agent automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? If enabled, the transaction tracer captures deep information about slow transactions. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Positive float or string (apdex_f) Default apdex_f Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds this threshold, the agent records a transaction trace. Valid values are any positive float, or apdex_f (four times apdex_t). transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default obfuscated Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Record SQL? When the transaction tracer is enabled, the agent can record SQL statements. The recorder has three modes: off (sends no SQL), raw (sends the SQL statement in its original form), and obfuscated (strips out numeric and string literals). Most web frameworks (including Django) parameterize SQL queries so they do not actually contain the values used to fill out the query. If you use raw mode with one of these frameworks, the Python agent will only see the SQL prior to insertion of values. The parametrized SQL will look much like obfuscated mode. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Stack trace threshold Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack traces from SQL calls. When SQL statements exceed this threshold, the agent captures the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate in an application. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable SQL query plans? Determines whether the Python agent will capture query plans for slow SQL queries. Only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Query plan threshold Queries in transaction traces that exceed this threshold will report slow query data and any available explain plans. Explain plan collection will not happen if transaction_tracer.explain_enabled is false. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to us in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_tracer.function_trace Type String Default (none) Set in Config file For the specified functions or methods, the agent will capture additional function timing instrumentation. Specify these names in the form module:function or module:class.function. Transaction segment configuration Here are Transaction segment settings available via the agent configuration file. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for segments of transaction traces. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to segments of transaction traces regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_segments.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_segments.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for segments of transaction traces, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_segments.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in segments of transaction traces. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Error collector configuration Here are error collector settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable error collection? If enabled, the error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions. error_collector.ignore_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these errors To stop collecting specific errors, set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to ignore. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip Before version 6.4.0 of the agent, this setting was named error_collector.ignore_errors. If your configuration file still uses ignore_errors, update your agent to use ignore_classes. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default 100-102 200-208 226 300-308 404 Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Ignore these status codes Lists HTTP status codes which the agent should ignore rather than record as errors. List additional status codes as integers separated by spaces, and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To add one of the default codes to your allow list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option can only be set in server-side configuration in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_classes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these error class names Prevents specified exception classes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. Set this to a space-separated list of the Python exception type names to be expected. Use the form module:class for the exception name. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default (none) Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Expect these status codes Prevents specified HTTP status codes from affecting error rate or Apdex score while still reporting the errors to APM. List status codes as integers separated by spaces and specify ranges with a hyphen - separator between the start and end values. To negate one of the codes in your list, preface the code with an exclamation point !. This setting is only compatible with some web frameworks, as some frameworks do not use exceptions to return HTTP responses. Tip This configuration option is only available in Python Agent versions 6.4.0 and newer. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless on how this configuration setting (error_collector.attributes.enabled) is set. error_collector.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file Attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in traced errors. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file If enabled, the error collector captures event data for advanced analytics. For more information, see APM Errors. Browser monitoring settings Here are browser monitoring settings available via the agent configuration file. browser_monitoring.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables browser monitoring. For more information, see Page load timing in Python. Important Before enabling browser monitoring in the config file, enable it in the application settings in the browser monitoring UI. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file For supported Python web frameworks, this setting enables auto-insertion of the browser monitoring JavaScript fragments. browser_monitoring.content_type Type String Default text/html Set in Config file Specify the HTML Content-Type(s) that our browser monitoring agent should auto-instrument. Add additional entries in a space-separated list. Instrument xhtml+xml page responses If you are generating HTML page responses and using the Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and the default text/html by using: browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml Copy Important The browser monitoring JavaScript snippet prevents the page from validating as application/xhtml+xml, although the page should load and render in end-user browsers. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data which gets sent to page view events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, no attributes will be sent up in browser monitoring regardless on how the configuration setting (browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled) is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Transaction events settings Here are Transaction events settings available via the agent configuration file. Tip These configuration settings used to be called analytic_events. If your configuration file still uses analytic_events, update your agent to use transaction_events. transaction_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Transaction event data allows the use of additional information such as histograms and percentiles. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false at the root level, then no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless on how this configuration setting (transaction_events.attributes.enabled) is set. transaction_events.attributes.include Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in transaction events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to in transaction events. Note that excluding attributes from transaction events does not exclude from span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Custom events settings Here are custom events settings available via the agent configuration file. custom_insights_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Allow recording of events to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). Datastore tracer settings These datastore tracer settings are available via the agent configuration file: datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are also reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file When enabled, the agent collects database name for some database drivers. The database name is reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. Distributed tracing settings Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Python agent version 4.2.0.100 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Settings include: distributed_tracing.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. Span event configuration Span events are collected for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Configuration options include: span_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off whether the Python agent sends spans. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file This setting can be used to turn on or off for all attributes for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this configuration setting (span_events.attributes.enabled) is set. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.include Type List of strings Default (none) Set in Config file If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. span_events.attributes.exclude Type List of Strings Default (none) Set in Config file All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Event harvest configuration Event harvest settings limit the amount of event type data sent to New Relic. When you use these settings, consider these important points: Event harvest settings affect the limits for a single instance of the agent, and not across the entire application. See the usage example below for how to set limits across an entire application. Real time streaming sends data every five seconds (12 times per minute), but the event harvest settings still affect the rate in events per minute. Enabling or disabling real time streaming does not require changing these settings. With real time streaming (enabled by default), New Relic will display the event harvest limits for entities in five second intervals. This means, for example, when you set a limit value of 1200 in the config file, you'll see it as 100 in New Relic. Usage example Let's say an application is deployed across 10 hosts, each running four processes per host. To limit the number of span events to 10,000 events per minute for the entire application, divide that number by 10 hosts. Then divide again by four processes per host. 10000 / (10 * 4) = 250 Based on that calculation, the final setting is: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data = 250 Event harvest configuration settings include: event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.analytic_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for analytic events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.custom_event_data Type Integer Default 1200 Set in Config file Limit for custom events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Custom events are created through the Python Telemetry SDK. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data Type Integer Default 1000 Set in Config file Limit for span events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.error_event_data Type Integer Default 100 Set in Config file Limit for error events per minute sent by an instance of the Python agent to New Relic. Event loop visibility settings Important Requires Python agent version 5.0.0.124 or higher. Event loop visibility surfaces information about transactions that block the event loop. The agent will generate information about transactions that have waited a significant amount of time to acquire control of the event loop. Settings include: event_loop_visibility.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Set this to false to disable event loop information. event_loop_visibility.blocking_threshold Type Float Default 0.1 Set in Config file Threshold in seconds for how long a transaction must block the event loop before generating event loop information. Garbage collection runtime metrics settings Important Requires Python agent version 6.2.0.156 or higher. These garbage collection runtime metrics settings are available via the agent configuration file: gc_runtime_metrics.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file When enabled, the agent will generate and send garbage collection metrics. gc_runtime_metrics.top_object_count_limit Type Integer Default 5 Set in Config file The agent reports object count metrics for the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector. For each object type, this setting allows you to set the maximum number of individual metrics that will be sampled. Other configuration settings Here are assorted other settings available via the agent configuration file. utilization.detect_aws Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an AWS environment. utilization.detect_azure Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in an Azure environment. utilization.detect_gcp Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Google Cloud Platform environment. utilization.detect_pcf Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment. utilization.detect_docker Type Boolean Default true If true, the agent automatically detects that it is running in Docker. slow_sql.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable Slow SQL? If enabled, the agent captures details from long-running SQL database queries. thread_profiler.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Server-side config, config file Server-side label Enable thread profiler? Enables you to schedule thread profiling sessions. The thread profiler will periodically capture a snapshot of the call stack for each active thread in the application to construct a statistically representative call tree. cross_application_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in Config file Enables cross application tracing, which connect your apps and services within your service-oriented architecture. strip_exception_messages.enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in Config file If enabled, exception messages will be stripped from error traces before they are sent to the collector, in order to prevent the inadvertent capture of sensitive information. This option is automatically enabled in high security mode. strip_exception_messages.whitelist Type String Default (none) Set in Config file Exceptions listed in your allow list will not have their messages stripped, even if strip_exception_messages.enabled is true. The allow list is a space-separated string of exception types, each in the form of module:exception_name. List built-in exceptions as exception_name; you do not need to prepend module: to them. Example: Built-in exception and user-defined exception KeyError my_module:MyException Copy startup_timeout Type Float Default 0.0 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT By default, the agent starts when it receives the first transaction (either web or non-web). The agent then starts in parallel, ensuring that this initial request is not delayed. However, the agent does not record the details of this initial request because the agent cannot collect data until registration is complete. To override this, you can set a startup timeout in seconds. The agent will then pause the initial transaction and wait for registration to complete. Important Since startup_timeout delays your app start, we recommend only setting a startup timeout for background task queuing systems, not web applications. shutdown_timeout Type Float Default 2.5 Set in Config file, environment variable Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT On process shutdown, the agent attempts one final upload to the collector. To prevent the agent running indefinitely in case of an issue, the process shuts down normally if the shutdown_timeout threshold is reached. This shutdown can result in data loss, but the agent prioritizes key metric data during the upload process. For background task queuing systems, especially those which run a small number of tasks per process, you may want to increase the shutdown timeout to ensure the agent can upload all data on process shutdown. Tip The agent defaults to a 2.5 second timeout because Apache and many other web servers have a 3.0 second process termination timeout. The agent exits at 2.5 seconds to allow atexit cleanup code registered for the process to run. compressed_content_encoding Type String Default gzip Set in Config file If the data compression threshold is reached in the payload, the agent compresses data, using gzip compression by default. The config option compression_content_encoding can be set to deflate to use deflate compression. Heroku heroku.use_dyno_names Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_USE_DYNO_NAMES If true, the agent uses Heroku dyno names as the hostname. heroku.dyno_name_prefixes_to_shorten Type Array Default [\"scheduler\", \"run\"] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HEROKU_DYNO_NAME_PREFIXES_TO_SHORTEN Ordinarily the agent reports dyno names with a trailing dot and process ID (for example, worker.3). You can remove this trailing data by specifying the prefixes you want to report without trailing data (for example, worker). Built-in instrumentation The Python agent instruments a range of Python packages/modules. This instrumentation only occurs when the target Python package/module is imported by an application. To disable default instrumentation, provide a special import-hook section corresponding to the name of the module that triggered instrumentation. Then set the enabled setting to false to disable instrumentation of that module. Example: Disabling MySQLdb database query instrumentation Add the following to the configuration file: [import-hook:MySQLdb] enabled = false Copy",

      "body": "Important Starting with version 5.9.0 of the New Relic Android agent, you can set a custom user identifier value to associate user sessions with analytics events and attributes. For more information, see the NewRelic.setUserId method. New Relic Mobile's Android agent provides an SDK API to set up custom instrumentation for monitoring your application. The API gives you the ability to: Instrument your own code. Create, name, and end interaction traces from events in your mobile app. Record custom metrics. Send custom attributes and events to New Relic Insights. Track networking from libraries not supported automatically. Install the SDK Before using the Android SDK API: Review the Android SDK API release notes to ensure you have your app instrumented with a current SDK for New Relic Mobile. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Add more data and then follow the steps for Android. For more information, see the detailed Android installation and configuration procedures. If you need to support Android 2.2, see the legacy Android agent SDK procedures. Instrument your code Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. If you have custom libraries or application code that you want to include in interaction traces: Use the following Java annotation: import com.newrelic.agent.android.instrumentation.Trace; Copy Add the @Trace annotation to the methods you want to instrument: @Trace public void myHeavyweightMethod() { … Copy To tell New Relic Mobile what kind of method is being traced, use the optional category attribute. Automatically instrumented methods Automatic instrumentation is one of the agent's more convenient features. However, if it interferes with the method being traced, add @SkipTrace to the method, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.

Name or rename an interaction See setInteractionName. End an interaction See endInteraction. Disable or enable all interactions See withInteractionTracing. Set an app version associated with an interaction See withApplicationVersion. Set custom build ID See withApplicationBuild. Create custom metrics See recordMetric. Report custom attributes and events There are several ways to add custom attributes and events. For more about which would be the best method to use and why, see Add custom data. Create an attribute: setAttribute Increment an attribute count: incrementAttribute Remove an attribute: removeAttribute Remove all attributes: removeAllAttributes Record custom event: recordCustomEvent Record a breadcrumb event: recordBreadcrumb Set the maximum size of an event pool: setMaxEventPoolSize Set maximum time agent stores events in memory: setMaxEventBufferTime Return the current session's ID: currentSessionId Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes: setUserId Track custom network requests and failures Use these methods: Record HTTP transactions at varying levels of detail: See noticeHttpTransaction. Record network failures: See noticeNetworkFailure. Record a handled exception as an event, including context See recordHandledException(). Manual cross application tracing The noticeHttpTransaction code does not automatically append the appropriate header ID value needed to get cross application tracing to work. This is why you will not see the application link in your Android app on New Relic's Map page for mobile apps or on the HTTP requests page. You can use a public method in the New Relic Android SDK to get the appropriate ID to pass along with your HTTP request to your back-end application, as long as it is already instrumented by New Relic. The appropriate header ID will be passed from the back-end application in the response, providing everything needed for cross application tracing to function. Cross application tracing example This example adds the NewRelic-ID to the back-end HTTP request, with conn as the external HTTP connection. (Notice the additional import.) import com.newrelic.agent.android.NewRelic; import com.newrelic.agent.android.Agent; //required for getCrossProcessId() ... ... //new method for appending the crossProcessID necessary for CAT in New Relic public static void setCrossProcessHeader(HttpURLConnection conn) { String crossProcessId = Agent.getCrossProcessId(); // API call into the agent for the X-NewRelic-ID if (crossProcessId != null) { conn.setRequestProperty(\"X-NewRelic-ID\", crossProcessId); } } Copy After adding the appropriate header to the request to the back-end app, the response from the app needs to be parsed for the X-Newrelic-App-Data header, and then added to the noticeHttpTransaction call as a string. For example: //NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(url, httpMethod, statusCode, startTimeMs, endTimeMs, bytesSent, bytesReceived, responseBody, params, response); //Where xNewRelicAppDataHeader is the value of the X-NewRelic-App-Data header NewRelic.noticeHttpTransaction(\"http://api.newrelic.com\", \"GET\", 200, System.nanoTime(), System.nanoTime(),100 ,100, \"Test\", new HashMap<String, String>(), xNewRelicAppDataHeader); Copy",

      "body": "The C SDK is designed to support the often complex, multi-threaded nature of C/C++ applications. You can gain a new level of visibility to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also collect and analyze data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. The C SDK can be used to instrument a wide range of applications beyond C or C++. If your application does not use other languages supported by New Relic and can import C libraries, then you can use the New Relic C SDK to take advantage of our monitoring capabilities and features. Tip To use the C SDK or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Monitor app performance one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app): Here is an example of some of the data you can view in New Relic after you deploy the C SDK for your app. If your app meets the C SDK's compatibility and requirements in Linux environments, you can customize the generic library to communicate with New Relic, then start with APM to monitor your app's performance. What you can do How to do it See the big picture Start with the APM Summary page to monitor the throughput, response times, errors, memory and CPU usage transactions in your applications and services, then explore other details with additional APM dashboards. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. When you install the infrastructure agent and APM on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by app in the Infrastructure UI. Identify and fix errors Use error analytics tools to find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. Get alert notifications for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Analyze business data Query user-related data and improve business processes. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create custom queries of your application data. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. And more! Monitor and troubleshoot your application users' desktop experience with your application, including page load timing problems, JavaScript errors, session trace timelines, etc., by using browser monitoring. Use automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints with synthetic monitoring. Analyze and fine-tune your Android and iOS application performance, troubleshoot crashes, compare multiple versions, and examine the performance of HTTP and other network components with mobile monitoring. Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); Copy If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost. Get started with the C SDK To use our C SDK agent: Make sure your application meets the compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. Use our launcher, or follow the installation and instrumentation procedures to install the agent. Within a few minutes, you will be able to view data from your application in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add C data Check the source code The C SDK is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "The C SDK is designed to support the often complex, multi-threaded nature of C/C++ applications. You can gain a new level of visibility to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also collect and analyze data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. The C SDK can be used to instrument a wide range of applications beyond C or C++. If your application does not use other languages supported by New Relic and can import C libraries, then you can use the New Relic C SDK to take advantage of our monitoring capabilities and features. Tip To use the C SDK or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Monitor app performance one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app): Here is an example of some of the data you can view in New Relic after you deploy the C SDK for your app. If your app meets the C SDK's compatibility and requirements in Linux environments, you can customize the generic library to communicate with New Relic, then start with APM to monitor your app's performance. What you can do How to do it See the big picture Start with the APM Summary page to monitor the throughput, response times, errors, memory and CPU usage transactions in your applications and services, then explore other details with additional APM dashboards. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. When you install the infrastructure agent and APM on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by app in the Infrastructure UI. Identify and fix errors Use error analytics tools to find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. Get alert notifications for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Analyze business data Query user-related data and improve business processes. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create custom queries of your application data. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. And more! Monitor and troubleshoot your application users' desktop experience with your application, including page load timing problems, JavaScript errors, session trace timelines, etc., by using browser monitoring. Use automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints with synthetic monitoring. Analyze and fine-tune your Android and iOS application performance, troubleshoot crashes, compare multiple versions, and examine the performance of HTTP and other network components with mobile monitoring. Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); Copy If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost. Get started with the C SDK To use our C SDK agent: Make sure your application meets the compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. Use our launcher, or follow the installation and instrumentation procedures to install the agent. Within a few minutes, you will be able to view data from your application in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add C data Check the source code The C SDK is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings.

In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "New Relic APM agents, browser agents, and mobile agents report a type of metric data called metric timeslice data. These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic. New Relic agent Implementation APM agents C SDK: newrelic_record_custom_metric() Go: app.RecordCustomMetric Java: recordMetric .NET: RecordMetric Node.js: recordMetric PHP: newrelic_custom_metric Python: record_custom_metric and register_data_source Ruby: record_metric and increment_metric New Relic mobile agents Android: recordMetric iOS: recordMetricWithName (Objective-C) or NewRelic.recordMetricWithName (Swift) New Relic browser agent Browser does not support custom metrics. For options on adding custom data to Browser, see Browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables. For more information, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "APM agents automatically report error data for supported frameworks. To optimize error reporting and alerting, you can further manage errors in order to: Catch errors that we don't instrument by default. Ignore errors that you don't want reported at all. Filter out noise from expected errors so you can focus on the errors that are affecting performance. (Java, Ruby, Node, Python, and .NET agents only) Collect errors not instrumented by default APM agents include API calls to report (or \"notice\") errors. These are useful when APM doesn't instrument your framework automatically or when there are particular errors that aren't caught for your supported framework. To learn how to get an APM agent to report an error, see the agent-specific API documentation: C SDK: newrelic_notice_error() Go: NoticeError() Java: NoticeError() .NET: NoticeError() Node.js: noticeError() PHP: newrelic_notice_error() Python: notice_error() Ruby: notice_error() Ignore errors Sometimes the APM agent instruments an error that you don't want reported, such as errors that contain sensitive information like user login errors. If you don't want an error to report to the our collector, you can ignore the error, and the APM agent discards the error entirely. Tip For Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Python: If you want to report errors to APM but don't want those errors to affect your Apdex or error rate, mark them as expected instead. There are two ways to ignore errors: through the agent configuration or through server-side configuration in the UI: Ignore errors using server-side configuration in the UI This option depends on whether the agent supports server-side configuration. If it is not already enabled, enable server-side configuration. Go to the Server-side configuration menu for the application that has errors that you want to ignore. Under Error collection, look for Ignore from error collection. Add the HTTP code or the Error class for the errors that you want to ignore. Select Save server-side configuration. Ignore errors using agent configuration To ignore an error using the agent configuration, see the configuration documentation for your agent: C SDK: Not available. For more information, see the C SDK errors example on GitHub. Go: ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes. Java: error_collector.ignore_classes, error_collector.ignore_classes.message, or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. For additional information, see Java agent error configuration. .NET: ignoreErrors or ignoreStatusCodes. Node.js: ignore_status_codes, ignore_classes, or ignore_messages. PHP: error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors. Python: error_collector.ignore_classes or error_collector.ignore_status_codes. Ruby: error_collector.ignore_errors. Expected errors (Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and .NET only) For the Ruby and Java agents, you can mark errors as expected. These errors will be reported to APM and available for viewing, but they won't affect the Apdex or error rate (or alert conditions based on error rate). To configure errors as expected, see the agent-specific documentation: Java Ruby Node.js .NET Python If expected errors are enabled, APM's Error analytics page will, by default, have a filter applied with the error.expected attribute set to false, meaning expected errors will not be displayed. To view expected errors, turn off the error.expected filter. To view expected errors, query your data: To view charts of expected errors, create a query for the error.expected attribute. To create alert conditions for NRQL queries, use the error.expected attribute. View errors in the UI Among other places, error data appears in these parts of the UI: Error analytics page: shows in-depth charts and visual analysis of errors. APM Overview page: shows a high-level view of your application, which includes errors. Alert conditions: can be based on error rate. The transactionError event: contains underlying error data, which can be used in NRQL queries.",

Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors.

This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument. The value for this argument must be HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening.",

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic C SDK installation. Add C data Tip To use the C SDK or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors. If you still have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips.",

Install C SDK in container environment Requirements: Meet C SDK requirements C SDK version 1.2 or higher Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon. This only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts. To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the C SDK daemon on a separate docker container: Install the daemon by cloning the C SDK repository and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument. The value for this argument must be HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic.

For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md.

Solution The New Relic C SDK and its daemon have their own logs: C SDK logs: These logs are generated due to errors in how you've instrumented your code using the New Relic C SDK API calls. Daemon logs: These are logs related to transmission of data to New Relic. To help troubleshoot an issue, we recommend generating logs at their highest level: Set the C SDK log to verbose level and the daemon log to debug level. Run both logs for 5-10 minutes. After generating logs for troubleshooting, return logging for both the C SDK and daemon to their default levels. Caution Elevated logging levels can create large log files and have a performance impact. Generate logs at this level only as long as necessary for troubleshooting. C SDK logs The C SDK has four log levels, as defined by the enum _newrelic_loglevel_t in libnewrelic.h. By default, logs are set to NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO and output to standard error. Log levels include: NEWRELIC_LOG_ERROR NEWRELIC_LOG_WARNING NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO (default) NEWRELIC_LOG_DEBUG Copy To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: Call newrelic_configure_log() in your application code, and set a log level. For example: newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO); Copy Daemon logs The C SDK daemon has four log levels. By default, logs are set to info and output to standard error. Log levels include: error warning info (default) debug Copy These log levels are invoked using flags from the command line: --logfile <DAEMON_FILE_NAME>. Sets the path to the log file. --loglevel <LOG_LEVEL>. Sets the log level. Default: info. Copy To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: From the command line, set a different log level flag. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug Copy",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them.

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. The agent strips QueryParameters from database segments. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Setting Effects on data security HighSecurity boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security (V2). This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. Attributes.Enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending some attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send these default attributes to New Relic, set Attributes.Enabled to false. Attributes.Exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using Attributes.Exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. For examples of how to disable the recording of each attribute, see their descriptions on the Go agent attributes page. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API using RecordCustomEvent. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. The agent strips QueryParameters from database segments. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Setting Effects on data security HighSecurity boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security (V2). This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. Attributes.Enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending some attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send these default attributes to New Relic, set Attributes.Enabled to false. Attributes.Exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using Attributes.Exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. For examples of how to disable the recording of each attribute, see their descriptions on the Go agent attributes page. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API using RecordCustomEvent. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. The agent strips QueryParameters from database segments. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Setting Effects on data security HighSecurity boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security (V2).

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. The agent strips QueryParameters from database segments. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Setting Effects on data security HighSecurity boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security (V2).

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic Go agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default security settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. The agent strips QueryParameters from database segments. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Setting Effects on data security HighSecurity boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security (V2).

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to New Relic APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in New Relic APM and New Relic Insights. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each New Relic APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest New Relic APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the query builder to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode. (If you start with basic mode, switch to advanced mode to complete the next step.) In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "When working with your data in New Relic, you may want to view aggregated data for an application across clusters, environments, or data centers, while at the same time be able to view each of your application instance's data individually. Important If you use multiple names for an app, the last name assigned is the least specific name New Relic uses to roll up the data. For best results to view both instance-level and aggregated data, set the order of your app's rollup names from most specific to least specific in your configuration file. Roll up app data Normally, when two instances report with the same app name, agent language, and license key, New Relic aggregates their data into a single app within the New Relic user interface. You can also view data for the individual hosts and instances from the app's New Relic APM Overview page. To segment your app in a different way, or to work with each instance as an individual app while maintaining the overall view of the data, use your New Relic agent's config file to give an app up to three different rollup names. New Relic will then report the app's data separately to each app listed in the config file. For example, you might want to separate the data collected for your app running in development, staging, and production environments, but also have a common view of the app in every environment. Or, if you have two data centers running the same code, you could name one app EastCoastApp;AggregateApp and the second app WestCoastApp;AggregateApp. Prevent duplicate transaction events By default, an app with multiple names will generate multiple events for transactions (a duplicate transaction for each name). For example, if you give your app three names, that's three times the number of events for transactions. To avoid duplicate events, disable collection for each of the duplicate app names: Go to one.newrelic.com or one.eu.newrelic.com > More > Manage Insights Data. Toggle data collection on/off for duplicate app names, then save. Roll up browser data When you use multiple names to report application data, any Browser monitoring data from that application will also be grouped into multiple applications using the same configuration. Important Session trace data will only report to the first application listed. Other Browser data will populate into each of the up to three applications, but session trace data will be limited to the most specific application. Define app names from most to least specific You can give each app up to three names, which New Relic uses to aggregate data from most to least specific. You can then use the New Relic UI to view data for each app name individually, as well as in aggregate for overall application performance. When doing so, the order in which you specify the app names is important. Using multiple names Comments Most specific A unique rollup name. Less specific A shared rollup name to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. This provides more general organization. Optional, least specific An additional, shared rollup name. If used, this is the most general name New Relic uses to aggregate data into a single app. Name app instances via agent config file The naming convention you use in your configuration file depends on your New Relic agent. Set the order of your app's names so that the first rollup name is the most unique. The second and third names can be unique, or they can be the same. The second name is more general for aggregate data, and the third name (if used) is the most general. Agent Configuration file value C Identify a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon ; in your newrelic_app_config_t * config;. Go Set AppName to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Java Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. .NET Use any of the available options to name your .NET app. Node.js Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a comma. Enclose the string of names with single or double quotes. (Or, change the environment variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME.) PHP Use any of the available options to name your PHP application. Use three names separated by a semicolon. Python Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. Do not add a space after the semicolon, or the next name will be interpreted as a comment. Ruby Set app_name to a maximum of three names separated by a semicolon. For more information, refer to the configuration file documentation for your agent. Examples Here are examples of how you could use multiple rollup names for a single app. One app, three clusters A Java app collecting survey data runs on three clusters. Change the value for the app name in your agent config file by giving it three different names, one for each cluster. Cluster 1: app_name: SurveyCluster1;Survey Data Copy Cluster 2: app_name: SurveyCluster2;Survey Data Copy Cluster 3: app_name: SurveyCluster3;Survey Data Copy This will report four applications in New Relic APM: The app name for aggregate data from all three clusters is Survey Data. Three individual applications named SurveyCluster1, SurveyCluster2, and SurveyCluster3. Two instances of one app A PHP agent is monitoring an e-commerce application running on two clusters in each of two data centers, and you want to view data for each subgroup as well as the overall aggregated data. Cluster A: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterA;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster B: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterB;EcomEast;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster C: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterC;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy Cluster D: newrelic.appname=\"EcomClusterD;EcomWest;EcomAll\" Copy This example configuration will report seven applications in the New Relic APM UI: Four apps: One for each of the four clusters (A B C D) Two apps: One for each datacenter (East and West) One app for the overall data across clusters and data centers (EcomAll) Other options to organize your apps If you do not want to apply multiple names to your apps, you can organize them with labels and categories. This allows you to easily sort, filter, and page through them from their product index pages in the New Relic UI. You can also set distinct performance thresholds for each environment with alert conditions and key transactions. These thresholds will apply to the individual apps, while the overall app will not have its own thresholds. The overall app will treat incoming data according to the threshold for the relevant enviroment.",

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The New Relic JFR daemon runs as its own Java process and monitors a JVM for JFR events over remote JMX. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. On startup the JFR daemon checks if the application you are monitoring is also being monitored by the New Relic Java agent. If the Java agent is present, then the daemon will obtain the entity GUID associated with the application. Both the JFR data and the data collected by the agent will then report to the same APM entity. If the the Java agent is not detected, then the daemon will report as a unique entity under the app name that you configured for it. Requirements Requirements include: Java 8 (version 8u262+) or higher for both the JFR daemon process, and the application process An Insert API key or an APM license key. JFR daemon jar. Required for flamegraphs, otherwise optional but recommended: Install of New Relic Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher on your JVM. The JFR daemon can run without a Java agent being included, but if the Java agent is present it will combine agent and daemon data into a single APM application. Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use about 150MB of additional memory. Installation The application that you wish to monitor with the JFR daemon must be configured to expose JFR data over remote JMX by adding the following system properties: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false Copy Tip By default, the JFR daemon will connect via JMX to localhost on port 1099 and send data to New Relic's US production metric and event ingest endpoints. Additionally, if you need the JFR daemon to report through a proxy that will require special configuration settings. To configure the JFR daemon's behavior, please see the fully documented configuration options. To use the JFR daemon: Download the latest version of the JFR daemon jar: jfr-daemon-n.n.n.jar. Register an Insert API key or an APM license key for publishing data to New Relic. Required: Assign your key to the INSIGHTS_INSERT_KEY environment variable. If you are using an APM license key then you will also need to set the USE_LICENSE_KEY=true environment variable. Recommended: Set the name of the application being monitored to the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable. If this is not set, then the default app name will be used instead. Start your application and the JFR daemon: java -jar jfr-daemon-n.n.n.jar Copy Optional (but recommended): Include the Java agent: Install Java agent version 6.1.0 or higher to monitor your application. Configure the Java agent to allow it to communicate with the JMX daemon by adding the following configuration to the newrelic.yml configuration file: jmx: enabled: true linkingMetadataMBean: true Copy Tip Enabling linkingMetadataMBean allows the JFR daemon to acquire the entity GUID that was generated by the Java agent for the application. If the entity GUID is successfully acquired, then data collected by the daemon will be reported to the same application as the Java agent. Any name configured for the daemon using NEW_RELIC_APP_NAMEwould be overridden in favor of the name specified by the agent.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life.

All other real-time profiling features are available by default. To request this early access, please email flamegraph@newrelic.com. At this time, this requires deployment of both the JFR daemon and Java agent and the daemon must be reporting as the same entity as the agent.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Java agent, make sure your WildFly version is supported. Depending on which WildFly version your application uses, additional configuration steps may be required. Install WildFly versions earlier than 11 If your supported WildFly version is earlier than v11, follow standard Java installation procedures. You do not need to do any additional configuration. Install WildFly version 11 or higher If you use WildFly version 11 or higher, New Relic's Java agent requires additional configuration after you install it. Install the Java agent. If you already have it installed, update to the latest Java agent version. Versions 5.0.0 and higher include fixes for later WildFly versions 11 and higher. Open the standalone configuration file appropriate for your operating system and add the -javaagent property to JAVA_OPTS.

      "body": "This document explains a basic installation of the APM agent for Java applications in a Docker container. We discuss required configurations and also explore some optional configurations, including: How to use identical New Relic configuration files for each container, regardless of the environment where the containers are used How to use the Docker layer when every agent in every environment needs slightly different configuration data How to disable the New Relic agent in some environments and enable it in others Although we don't discuss advanced options here, you can install the Java agent in Docker volumes and use your Docker container image in other software such as Swarm, ECS, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. Our Docker examples refer to Tomcat, so if you are using another application server, refer to your vendor’s documentation.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Get the Java agent Download newrelic-java.zip using curl, Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell), or the New Relic UI: Download using curl Complete the following: Start a command-line session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this curl command: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip Download using Invoke-WebRequest (PowerShell) Complete the following: Start a PowerShell session. Change to a temporary directory where you can download the zip file. Execute this PowerShell command: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.newrelic.com/newrelic/java-agent/newrelic-agent/current/newrelic-java.zip -OutFile newrelic-java.zip Copy Unzip newrelic-java.zip: Expand-Archive -Path newrelic-java.zip -DestinationPath DESTINATION_PATH Copy Download from the New Relic UI Complete the following: Log in to New Relic. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings. In the right sidebar under Most recent, select the Java agent, and save the newrelic-java.zip to a temporary directory. Unzip newrelic-java.zip. Set up the installation directory You can unzip the newrelic-java.zip file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in ./newrelic. Modify startup scripts The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java’s built-in argument -javaagent. We recommend that you set this argument with the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you ADD the Java APM agent’s jar file to the image. For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the Dockerfile: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar\" Copy Set agent configurations By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in newrelic.yml, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these newrelic.yml configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the Dockerfile. Before we look at some specific configurations, here’s how to load newrelic.yml using the Dockerfile: ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml Copy For a basic Docker installation, complete these configurations: Application name License key Logs Environment (optional) Enabled (optional) Application name The application name is a configuration you set to identify your application in New Relic. Tip You can reuse an application name for multiple apps serving the same role so that all the data from those apps rolls up into the same logical application in New Relic. For more detail about additional grouping options, see Use multiple names for an app. Replace MY_APP_NAME with your application name in one of these Dockerfile commands: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"MY_APP_NAME\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.app_name='MY_APP_NAME'\" Copy After you boot the container, your application name appears in New Relic. License key This configuration is required for you to report on any data in your New Relic Account. To copy your license key: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. Under Account information, copy the license key. In one of these Dockerfile commands, replace MY_LICENSE_KEY with your license key: Option Command Environment variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=\"MY_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dnewrelic.config.license_key='MY_LICENSE_KEY'\" Copy Logs By default, logs are written into the logs directory relative to the location of newrelic.jar. Make sure that the user account that starts your application server also has the right to perform tasks such as: Creating the logs directory. Creating and appending to the log files in that directory. Here’s a Dockerfile example where tomcat is the user who starts Tomcat: RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs RUN chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/logs Copy You can also send the logs to STDOUT by adding one of the following to the Dockerfile: Option Command Environment Variable ENV NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME=STDOUT Copy Java system property ENV JAVA_OPTS=-Dnewrelic.config.log_file_name=STDOUT Copy Environment (optional) You can pass either a Java property or an environment variable to determine which of the environment-specific stanzas the agent uses in newrelic.yml. Use this approach if you prefer to have the newrelic.yml file control environment-specific configurations instead of passing all the configurations via Docker. Here’s a Dockerfile example of passing the newrelic.environment Java system property via Docker to use the custom value dev in the environment stanza of newrelic.yml: Using the shell form of the CMD instruction, include a reference to a new environment variable you choose (for example, ENV): CMD java -Dnewrelic.environment=$ENV -jar myjar.jar Copy In your docker run command line, include an argument to set the environment variable in the container: docker run -it -e \"ENV=dev\" myDockerImage Copy Important If you don’t specify a value for newrelic.environment, the agent assumes it is running in your production environment and uses the values from the main body of the configuration file. Enabled (optional) This configuration controls whether the agent is enabled. Let’s say you want the same Docker image for every installation. However, you don’t want to run the New Relic agent every time an engineer spins up a test app because you don’t want to run up your instance count. This problem can be solved using the newrelic.environment Java system property. In the main body of newrelic.yml, disable the Java agent by setting enabled: false. In specific environment stanzas of newrelic.yml, set enabled: true. Then, you can run specific agents by specifying the environment at runtime.
