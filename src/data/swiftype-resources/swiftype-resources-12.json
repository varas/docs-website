This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Machines reports data about your VMs service, like the VM ID, the VM size, the availability set, and the region name. You can monitor and alert on your Azure VMs data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards. Requirements Requirements include: New Relic infrastructure agent installed with Infrastructure agent version 1.0.775 or higher. (Update the infrastructure agent.) New Relic Azure integrations activated Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Important You must install the infrastructure agent on each VM to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Azure subscription allows New Relic to access VM metadata. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Virtual Machines integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and look for the integration. You can query and explore your data using the AzureVirtualMachineSample event type. The provider value is AzureVirtualMachine.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Machines reports data about your VMs service, like the VM ID, the VM size, the availability set, and the region name. You can monitor and alert on your Azure VMs data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards. Requirements Requirements include: New Relic infrastructure agent installed with Infrastructure agent version 1.0.775 or higher. (Update the infrastructure agent.) New Relic Azure integrations activated Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Important You must install the infrastructure agent on each VM to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Azure subscription allows New Relic to access VM metadata. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Virtual Machines integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and look for the integration. You can query and explore your data using the AzureVirtualMachineSample event type. The provider value is AzureVirtualMachine. For more on how to find and use integration data, see Understand and use data. Inventory data Inventory data is information about your system's state and configuration. For details on how to find and use inventory data, see Understand and use data. The Azure Virtual Machines integration reports this inventory data: availabilitySet bootDiagnosticsEnabled image linuxConfiguration name networkInterfaces osDisk provisioningState regionName resourceGroupName (deprecates resourceGroup) vmId vmSize windowsConfiguration Other system data The Azure Virtual Machines integration also collects the following attributes about the service and its configuration: Region Availability zone Instance type Instance ID Troubleshooting If you use Host not reporting alert conditions, the importing of Azure metadata for your VMs will change the hosts registry and result in false alert notifications. To prevent false positives: For each Azure instance, disable its Host not reporting alert condition. Update the infrastructure agent for all instances that used this alert condition. Re-enable each Host not reporting alert condition.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals.

This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be captured. Features New Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Machines reports data about your VMs service, like the VM ID, the VM size, the availability set, and the region name. You can monitor and alert on your Azure VMs data from New Relic, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards. Requirements Requirements include: New Relic infrastructure agent installed with Infrastructure agent version 1.0.775 or higher. (Update the infrastructure agent.) New Relic Azure integrations activated Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. Important You must install the infrastructure agent on each VM to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Azure subscription allows New Relic to access VM metadata. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the Virtual Machines integration: Polling interval: 5 minutes Resolution: 1 data point per minute Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and look for the integration. You can query and explore your data using the AzureVirtualMachineSample event type. The provider value is AzureVirtualMachine. For more on how to find and use integration data, see Understand and use data. Inventory data Inventory data is information about your system's state and configuration. For details on how to find and use inventory data, see Understand and use data. The Azure Virtual Machines integration reports this inventory data: availabilitySet bootDiagnosticsEnabled image linuxConfiguration name networkInterfaces osDisk provisioningState regionName resourceGroupName (deprecates resourceGroup) vmId vmSize windowsConfiguration Other system data The Azure Virtual Machines integration also collects the following attributes about the service and its configuration: Region Availability zone Instance type Instance ID Troubleshooting If you use Host not reporting alert conditions, the importing of Azure metadata for your VMs will change the hosts registry and result in false alert notifications. To prevent false positives: For each Azure instance, disable its Host not reporting alert condition. Update the infrastructure agent for all instances that used this alert condition. Re-enable each Host not reporting alert condition.",

The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use.

The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals.

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection url. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you send data of your choosing to the New Relic platform, where it can be analyzed, used to create queries and custom charts, and used as a basis for alert conditions. Important Starting June 1st 2021, the StatsD v1 integration is no longer supported. Find more details in this post. We have a newer, improved StatsD integration version. The diagram shows the basics of how the StatsD integration sends data to New Relic. Your app or components send data to StatsD. The New Relic backend takes the aggregated StatsD metric data and sends it to the infrastructure agent using socket communication. Finally, the agent sends the data to the New Relic collector. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Requirements Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A StatsD service Install the infrastructure agent on the host you are monitoring A Linux distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent Install and activate Important Note that we have a newer StatsD integration. To activate the New Relic StatsD integration: Ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of the infrastructure agent. Edit the infrastructure agent config file to enable the HTTP endpoint by adding: http_server_enabled: true http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host) http_server_port: 8001 #(default port) Copy This is the default URL and port; you can edit them based on your preferences. Restart the agent. Install the New Relic .js backend in the StatsD backends directory. Example: cd /path/to/statsd npm install @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend Copy Configure StatsD to run the New Relic StatsD backend by adding @newrelic/statsd-infra-backend to the StatsD config.js list of backends, like so: backends: [\"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\"] Copy Recommendation: Before doing further configuration, finish this installation process and then verify that integration is working. Restart StatsD. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Verify that the integration is working Before you configure the StatsD config file, verify that the integration is capable of sending data: Use the example StatsD config file in place of your StatsD configuration file. Tell the config file to send data with this terminal command: echo \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric:2000|c\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125 Copy Wait a few minutes, then run the following New Relic Insights query to confirm the data was reported: Select * from MyorgApplicationSample Copy Configure the integration After installation and verification, you can further configure the StatsD config file. The config file accepts the following parameters. For more information, see the example config files. Parameter Description port The port where the infrastructure agent is listening for StatsD data, as configured in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml. host The IP address of the parent host containing the New Relic infrastructure agent. rules An array of rules to filter metrics sent by StatsD to the New Relic StatsD backend. Using rules allows you to be specific about which metrics to record and how they should be sent to New Relic. Each rule can include one or more of these parameters: Important The eventType parameter is required in order to query the metrics in Insights. matchExpression Report only metrics matching a JavaScript regular expression. metricSchema The schema to be matched to the regular expression. This allows you to use parts of the metric name received by StatsD to define the metric name in New Relic and its associated metadata. The elements defined in the schema, which are inherited from the metricExpression, can be used in other parameters. For example, in the config file example, {hostname} is used to represent one of the parameters. If you used {hostname} in another parameter, it would substitute the detected value, in this case localhost. eventType (naming data) The name of the event type sample where all metrics matching this rule will be stored. New Relic strongly recommends following the convention below when naming your event types: Use camel case. Use the name of your organization as a prefix. This is to ensure the event type you use is unique. More detail on this below. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Examples: MyorgNginxStatsdSample, MyorgApplicationStatsdSample. The organizational prefix is important to avoid collision with New Relic's default event types. For example, if you named your event type NginxSample, you would be mixing your data with the standard Nginx data generated by the out-of-the-box New Relic integration. This would cause confusion to your users and create some unexpected results when running queries. For more information, see Naming tips. labels A hash containing a list of key-value pairs that will be applied to metrics matching this the rule. Labels will be stored in a namespace named label in New Relic; for example: label.environment = \"production\". You can use variables defined in the metricSchema as values for your labels. Find and use data To use your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the StatsD integration links. In New Relic Insights, StatsD integration data is attached to the MyorgApplicationSample event type (assuming you've followed the event naming conventions). For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in New Relic in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic's event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the StatsD data reported to New Relic. For this reason, it's recommended you follow the event naming conventions to ensure you have a consistent naming scheme. It's also recommended you use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. For example: suppose you have an application named app1 and app2 that reports the following metrics: App1.net.requests App1.net.average_response_time App1.system.memory_used Copy App2.net.requests App2.net.average_response_time app2.system.memory_used Copy By giving each app a different name but the same metrics, you could generate a sample for each similar to: application: \"app1\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy application: \"app2\" net.requests: 234 net.average_reponse_time: 23 Copy Example StatsD configuration files The first example StatsD configuration file in this section can be used for doing an initial test of the integration after installation. The second config file is more complete and complex, and should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. Simple example config file This example config file is used for install verification. { debug: false, port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ { matchExpression: \"app1.production.localhost.sample_metric\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyorgApplicationSample\", labels: { role: \"test\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy Complete example config file This example should give you an idea of how your own StatsD config file will look after configuration. { debug: false, graphitePort: 2003, graphiteHost: \"localhost\", port: 8125, backends: [ \"@newrelic/statsd-infra-backend\" ], newrelic: { port: 8001, host: \"localhost\", rules: [ // statsd metric keys: // - myapp.production.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // - myapp.staging.redis.redisA.replication.connected_slaves // schema substitution: // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"production\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} // - {app: \"myapp\", environment: \"staging\", service: \"redis\", serviceName: \"redisA\", metricName: \"replication.connected_slaves\"} { matchExpression: \"myapp.*redis.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{service}.{serviceName}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgRedisStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"cache\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, // statsd metric keys: // - mywebsite.staging.myhostname.connections.accepted // schema substitution: // - {app: \"mywebsite\", environment: \"staging\", hostname: \"myhostname\", notimportant: \"connections\", metricName: \"accepted\"} { matchExpression: \"mywebsite.*\", metricSchema: \"{app}.{environment}.{hostname}.{notimportant}.{metricName}\", eventType: \"MyOrgNginxStatsdSample\", labels: { role: \"webserver\", environment: \"{environment}\" } }, ] } } Copy",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

      "body": "New Relic APM agents, browser agents, and mobile agents report a type of metric data called metric timeslice data. These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic. New Relic agent Implementation APM agents C SDK: newrelic_record_custom_metric() Go: app.RecordCustomMetric Java: recordMetric .NET: RecordMetric Node.js: recordMetric PHP: newrelic_custom_metric Python: record_custom_metric and register_data_source Ruby: record_metric and increment_metric New Relic mobile agents Android: recordMetric iOS: recordMetricWithName (Objective-C) or NewRelic.recordMetricWithName (Swift) New Relic browser agent Browser does not support custom metrics. For options on adding custom data to Browser, see Browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables.

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Metrics Explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Metrics Explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here.

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic.

Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint.

To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release).

If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release).

The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running.

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer.

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Metrics Explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is an emerging standard for service-level instrumentation. Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic. New Relic agent Implementation APM agents C SDK: newrelic_record_custom_metric() Go: app.RecordCustomMetric Java: recordMetric .NET: RecordMetric Node.js: recordMetric PHP: newrelic_custom_metric Python: record_custom_metric and register_data_source Ruby: record_metric and increment_metric New Relic mobile agents Android: recordMetric iOS: recordMetricWithName (Objective-C) or NewRelic.recordMetricWithName (Swift) New Relic browser agent Browser does not support custom metrics. For options on adding custom data to Browser, see Browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables. For more information, see Metric grouping issues.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports only x86 processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit architecture (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible linux operating sytems. Built-in log forwarding and on-host integrations are not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems: Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). Important Operating systems are not supported beyond manufacturer end-of-life. Tip You can monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Important Servers named localhost are not reported: it's a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

Solution When running the integration in a huge cluster scraping hundreds of targets, CPU and memory consumption will increase, and the number of workers could affect scrape_duration. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image. Decrease worker_threads from the default value of 4 to your preferred value.",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Use the example configuration file, or look at the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file, which includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map and an example configuration. Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Docker container. Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the http://localhost:8080/metrics endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself. Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Start the integration in the background: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:1.5 Copy Confirm the container is running properly: docker ps -f \"name=nri-prometheus\" Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Kubernetes installation Important To prevent your data from being duplicated, configure your New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration only with one replica. Running two or more replicas will result in duplicated data. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures for restarts and gaps in data. To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest .yaml file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file: Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. env: - name: LICENSE_KEY value: \"<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>\" [...] config.yaml: | cluster_name: \"<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>\" Copy Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. By default, the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the deployment has been created successfully, look at the CURRENT replicas in the results generated by this command: kubectl get deployments nri-prometheus Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Update the integration To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker or Kubernetes as applicable: Docker update procedures Remove the Docker container. Follow standard installation procedures to start a new Docker container. The integration logs its current version when it starts up. To determine the running version: docker logs nri-prometheus 2>&1 | grep \"Integration version\" Copy Example output: time=\"2019-02-26T09:21:21Z\" level=info msg=\"Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version 1.0.0 \" Copy Kubernetes update procedures Follow standard installation procedures.

This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Use the example configuration file, or look at the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file, which includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map and an example configuration. Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Docker container. Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the http://localhost:8080/metrics endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself. Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Start the integration in the background: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:1.5 Copy Confirm the container is running properly: docker ps -f \"name=nri-prometheus\" Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Kubernetes installation Important To prevent your data from being duplicated, configure your New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration only with one replica. Running two or more replicas will result in duplicated data. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures for restarts and gaps in data. To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest .yaml file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file: Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. env: - name: LICENSE_KEY value: \"<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>\" [...] config.yaml: | cluster_name: \"<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>\" Copy Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. By default, the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the deployment has been created successfully, look at the CURRENT replicas in the results generated by this command: kubectl get deployments nri-prometheus Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Update the integration To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker or Kubernetes as applicable: Docker update procedures Remove the Docker container. Follow standard installation procedures to start a new Docker container. The integration logs its current version when it starts up.

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint.

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed.

To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

      "body": "To query and visualize the metrics collected for your Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration with New Relic, you can use NRQL. You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed. To view the number of connected Redis clients per pod in the default namespace: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE namespaceName='default' FACET podName TIMESERIES Copy Docker: View average memory free for scraped endpoints This example assumes you are scraping node exporters for Docker and want to use OpenMetrics. To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

Solution When running the integration in a huge cluster scraping hundreds of targets, CPU and memory consumption will increase, and the number of workers could affect scrape_duration. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image.

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image.

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Copy Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours? Existing usage data can also be a helpful research input. 3. Define SLOs Using the research on customer expectations that you gathered, draft a focused set of SLOs. New Relic recommends setting SLOs against one or more of the following SLIs: Application availability percentage Average response time Response percentile Error rate Apdex value Also, consider instrumenting and tracking the following SLIs: Throughput (peak and trough) Database call count and duration DNS and SSL timing DOM processing and page rendering Mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) For a more comprehensive list of potential areas to measure, see Measuring DevOps. Recommendation: To determine if your application is performing to customer expectations: Consider combining multiple SLIs (for example, availability and response time) into one SLO. Aim to define a consistent set of conditions across all of the services in your list. Consult your team and stakeholders to validate that the SLOs you set are reasonable, consistently attainable (even if you are not currently meeting them), and aligned to customer expectations. After you finish this step, you should have a set of well-defined SLOs and SLIs. 4. Determine what can be instrumented Now you're ready to deploy agents or monitors to establish a performance baseline for the SLIs you created. With proper instrumentation in place, you'll have visibility into the performance indicators that matter for your team and your customers. In addition, you'll also have a clear understanding of how to meet your SLOs. Identify the service components your team will optimize. Verify which application tiers meet New Relic monitoring requirements. To ensure you have robust baselines from which to work, determine the level of instrumentation that is possible (or allowed) within your organization. It's best practice to instrument everything you can, but there may be situations where instrumentation isn't viable. In that case, you should determine what other data is available or can be created. For example, you can gather logs to query them for SLO data and set alerts for them. one.newrelic.com > Logs: Use the New Relic log management UI to leverage your logs. If the application has a web front end in these situations, use New Relic synthetic monitors. Our synthetic monitors offer non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. To instrument the example applications and components in this tutorial, use these New Relic features: New Relic products Customer type Component name Tier owner Language stack Server OS New Relic products External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 APM, infrastructure monitoring, synthetic monitors Internal Service 2 Jane A. .Net Win2003 R2 APM, infrastructure monitoring Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX APM External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Synthetic monitors Internal MS SQL Dave Z. NA Win2003 R2 Infrastructure monitoring, on-host integrations APM installation After reviewing the compatibility and requirements for New Relic APM, install an APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language agent type. Follow the install procedures for a specific APM agents. Infrastructure installation After reviewing the requirements for New Relic infrastructure monitoring, follow the install procedures to install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. The infrastructure agent requires the following host permissions: Linux: To install and run the agent, you must have root privileges. Windows: To install and run the agent, you must have Administrator privileges. Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations based on their availability. New Relic supports several commonly used application components, including MySQL, Apache, NGINX, and more. For more information, see our on-host integration docs. Synthetics New Relic synthetic monitoring gives you a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. Follow the procedures to create a simple browser check. Be sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the Synthetics public network locations. Browser monitoring New Relic browser monitoring provides deep insights into how your users are interacting with your application or website. Browser monitoring complements synthetic monitors with data based on actual user experiences, which is useful in discerning how DevOps efforts are ultimately improving the experience for the customer. For more information, see the compatibility and requirements, then install the New Relic browser agent. Mobile monitoring The growing role of mobile apps in customer experience often spurs new performance data needs. Installation of New Relic mobile monitoring lets DevOps teams instrument iOS and Android applications to gain a fuller understanding of service delivery quality. 5. Review the default metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, use service maps to review the default metrics that New Relic captures. For example, a typical service map show many of the common SLIs that application teams rely on, including response time, Apdex, throughput, and error rate metrics from APM. It also shows page load time, Ajax response, throughput, and error rate from browser monitoring. rpm.newrelic.com > Service maps: To explore detailed granularity for any area, use the service map's nodes. 6. Set up custom instrumentation To close any remaining gaps in visibility for your SLIs, use custom instrumentation. New Relic provides several avenues for adding custom instrumentation, including: Making API calls to agents from inside your source code Packaging XML-based custom instrumentation modules with deployed applications Adding UI-based instrumentation without a code deploy In addition, you can add custom attributes to each transaction event that match application performance factors to critical business information. Then you can track those attributes in Insights dashboards. For more information, see the custom instrumentation documentation for your application: APM Browser Infrastructure Insights Mobile Synthetics 7. Create dashboards to track SLIs Once you implement the appropriate instrumentation, it's easy to visualize your service level indicators with New Relic dashboards, which provide a single location to query and view all the data that New Relic tools gather. To learn more about how to run queries to produce charts and dashboards, see Introduction to query builder. For more about the data you can query, see New Relic data types. The metrics you capture will become your application's baseline. Share dashboards with your application team and stakeholders to provide visibility into what is happening with your application and to monitor future performance.",

      "body": "A DevOps transformation requires a cultural shift so that teams can build new skills and motivations for the type of cross-team work required in a true DevOps practice. The transformation can be difficult when the people involved do not see the benefits of change as a clear objective. Service level objectives (SLOs) provide a powerful mechanism to codify the goals of a DevOps team in a way that can be measured and shared. They also provide clear boundaries on service expectations that help teams achieve greater velocity and freedom in experimenting with new approaches. This tutorial defines SLOs for successful service delivery objectives and utilize New Relic instrumentation to surface the current performance metrics relative to those objectives. Measurable SLOs and visibility into your current progress against those SLOs ensure that you will be able to properly assess future optimization efforts. Service level components An SLO is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI); for example: Average response time Response time percentile Application availability SLOs clarify a target value for SLIs; for example: Average response time should be less than 200 ms 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms Availability of the service should be 99.99% Logically group SLOs together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether or not the service is meeting expectations. For example, a helpful SLO for alerting purposes could be: 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99% Copy Service level components Example values SLI (Indicator) HTTP status codes SLO (Objective) < 1% HTTP 500s over 30 days SLA (Agreement) For every additional .1% of HTTP 500s, 5% refund of total contract Resources Value stream mapping can be a useful exercise to work through before setting SLOs. Work with your teams to clarify key components of your service and the appropriate metrics. Use these inputs as starting points for this tutorial. In addition: Learn about SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs from the Google Cloud Platform blog. Learn how New Relic has applied SLOs and SLIs into its reliability practices form this SREcon18 Americas presentation (approximately 21 minutes). 1. Build an inventory of services requiring SLOs Start defining SLOs for your application by first taking an inventory of the services that your application provides to both your internal and external customers. Draft a list of services. Make the scope of services you consider as comprehensive as possible. Engage your team members and other stakeholders to validate the list for completeness. Segment your application stack to understand the potential components that might require SLOs. For example, most applications can be segmented as: Application (backend/microservices) Dependency services (such as the message queue) Database Website Underlying servers This example lists components that would benefit from SLOs: Customer type Component name Owner Language stack Operating system External Service 1 John D. Java RHEL 6 Internal Service 2 Jane A. .NET Win2003 R2 Internal ActiveMQ John D. Java AIX External Website Jane A. Classic ASP Win2000 Internal MS SQL Dave Z. n/a Win2003 R2 Building a definitive list of services that require an SLO can be challenging, because an application often consists of many endpoints with complex interdependencies. Begin your SLO journey with pragmatism. Start by defining a broader, simpler set of SLOs that are driven by what your customers care about most and what your team can control. As your teams better align around SLOs, you can then begin to fine-tune and add more complexity. 2. Research customer expectations for SLOs Once you have an inventory of services, begin to gather the information you need to define the SLOs for those services. Interviews with customers that depend on your services are often valuable for understanding service expectations. For example, to define SLOs for internal teams, New Relic, ask questions such as: If possible, can you broadly categorize the types of requests we can expect from you and your service? To what extent do you or your service depend on timely responses to requests? Are there requests for which response time is not critical? How does your service handle unavailable dependencies or data? What is the maximum amount of unavailable data that your service can handle? At what threshold does your service fail if a request takes too long? What are acceptable rates of errors? What would a SLA look like between our product and yours?

Our mobile SDK agent collects and sends specific data to the New Relic collector, including: Mobile data collected Comments Devices Length of application session Wireless carrier's name The device's model name and manufacturer, and its operating system version Certain package, class, method, and thread names A unique instance identifier Requests and responses URLs of HTTP requests, along with HTTP status code, response time, and size of the request and response body Operating system error code for network failures (HTTP requests that fail to complete) The first 2KB of the response body when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code Android only: A stack trace when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code The agent sends all data using HTTPS encryption and validates the collector's SSL certificate. This prevents common data sniffing and server spoofing attacks. The agent also removes the query string, fragment identifier, username, and password from each URL before sending the data. Secure data endpoints Our mobile SDK agent sends harvested data to the collectors for processing. You can redirect those data posts to proxy or delegate servers for secure data handling. Android: You can use APIs to specify the URI authority of harvest and crash collector data endpoints. For more information, see the Android agent configuration and feature flags documentation. iOS: For more information, see the iOS agent configuration and feature flags documentation. Unique identifiers Our mobile SDK agent assigns a unique identifier to each installed app instance in order to track discrete installs, identify recurring sessions, and correlate performance over time. Mobile agent Identifiers Android Our Android agent generates a cryptographically strong UUID and stores it in the app's SharedPreferences. For more information, see our Android compatibility and requirements documentation. iOS The security measures used for iOS depend on the agent version. In versions 5.3.5 or higher, the iOS agent uses the IdentifierForVendor property to provide a unique device ID. In versions 5.3.4 or lower, the iOS agent used the SecureUDID open source library. SecureUDID is used by many third party libraries and is an accepted industry standard that does not violate Apple App store guidelines. SecureUDID does not use device hardware identifiers such as IMEI. Note that our mobile SDK does not collect IDFA (Identity For Advertisers). For more information, see our iOS compatibility and requirements documentation. No remote updates New Relic does not have the ability to update mobile agents remotely. Using the agent will not introduce any code into your mobile app without your knowledge. Data storage Our mobile SDK agent stores configuration information using your app's normal preferences or settings API on the mobile device. This configuration includes your: Application token Application version number Android or iOS SDK agent version number Settings such as the maximum number of HTTP requests to track per minute Performance data is buffered in memory. It is never written to the device's storage. Server-side data storage for mobile apps is handled in the same way as all other applications monitored by New Relic. For more information, see our security documentation about hosting and data storage. In general, we retain performance data according to the more generous time period of either your web or your mobile subscription. We also retain aggregate records of the number of active instances of your application. Instrumentation added to your code Our mobile SDK agent injects code into certain method calls within your application in order to collect performance data. This can have the effect of adding stack frames to your application's call graph where our code executes. This allows us to time and monitor the inputs and outputs of various APIs. This added code has been reviewed and tested for security-related flaws, and it incorporates best practices related to secure coding. Because our code runs within your application's process, it is subject to the same rights and restrictions as your own code. In addition, our iOS agent registers an NSURLProtocol handler to track NSURLConnection-based networking activity. This instrumentation is compatible with other custom NSURLProtocol handlers your application may register. The handler is registered within a single application process, so it is unable to monitor networking requests originating from other applications or the underlying operating system. User's IP address Our mobile SDK agent captures the user's IP address to enrich data for additional user information. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details and allows our customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: App name Country code Region Postal code Latitude Longitude Area code For more information about events and attributes for mobile monitoring, see our data dictionary. New Relic does not retain the user's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is cached in memory for up to six hours before being discarded. If you have questions or concerns about this use of IP addresses with regards to your own regulatory obligations for notice and consent, please contact your privacy or legal teams.",

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the FIT Instrumentation with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic”), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: http://newrelic.com/terms IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION. 1. DEFINITIONS “FIT Instrumentation” means the New Relic custom-made software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the FIT Instrumentation shall be treated like an “Agent”, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the FIT Instrumentation solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the FIT Instrumentation and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the FIT Instrumentation in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the FIT Instrumentation, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the FIT Instrumentation is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that FIT Instrumentation will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the FIT Instrumentation except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the FIT Instrumentation; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the FIT Instrumentation; (iv) use the FIT Instrumentation to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the FIT Instrumentation to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the FIT Instrumentation; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER. THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE AND NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING. THE ADD-ON IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ERROR-FREE, COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS FROM USE OF THE ADD-ON THEREFROM. 4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION. Customer agrees and acknowledges that: (a) the Add-on is not an official product and has not been commercially released for sale by New Relic; (b) the Add-on may not operate properly, being in final form, or fully functional; (c) the Add-on may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, design flaws, or other problems; (d) it may not be possible to make the Add-on fully functional; (e) the information obtained using the Add-on may not be accurate; (f) use of the Add-on may result in unexpected results, loss of data, delays or other unpredictable damages or loss; (g) New Relic is under no obligation to release a commercial version of the Add-on; and (h) New Relic has the right unilaterally to abandon development of the Add-on, at any time and without any obligation or liability to Customer. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1 Terms of Service; Documentation. This Agreement shall be considered a part of the New Relic documentation, located at: https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation). This Agreement and the Terms of Service constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-on. In the absence of a separate agreement, upon agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-On, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern the relationship between New Relic and Customer with respect to such Add-On. To the extent of a conflict between the Agreement and the Terms of Service, this Agreement shall govern with respect to the Add-on only.",

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation.

Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. Open source project categories New Relic Open Source Projects are assigned to one of five different categories. These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account. Community projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github or Community. New Relic One catalog: Support requests can be made through the Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. Example code: Project support is through Github channel.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here. Some default reporting limits are located in these tools' configuration docs. Manage data Want to manage your New Relic data ingest and storage to improve data organization or reduce billing?

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. Open source project categories New Relic Open Source Projects are assigned to one of five different categories. These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account. Community projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github or Community. New Relic One catalog: Support requests can be made through the Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. Example code: Project support is through Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. New Relic experimental: Projects have no ongoing maintenance, development or support. Archived: Projects are read-only, are not actively maintained, and do not have support.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. Open source project categories New Relic Open Source Projects are assigned to one of five different categories. These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account. Community projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github or Community. New Relic One catalog: Support requests can be made through the Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. Example code: Project support is through Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. New Relic experimental: Projects have no ongoing maintenance, development or support. Archived: Projects are read-only, are not actively maintained, and do not have support.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here.

By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse.

CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION.

New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries.

More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products.

Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

New Relic Pre-Release Policy Through your use of any New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”) Pre-Release Services (as further defined), you signify that you have read, understood, and accept the terms of this Pre-Release Policy (the “Policy”) governing your use and participation in New Relic’s program for making beta, alpha and pre-release versions of New Relic software (i.e. agents, SDKs, APIs, integrations, private locations, code, etc.), services, features, user-interfaces, and platforms made available for evaluation purposes (the “Pre-Release Service(s)”). This Policy is effective on behalf of yourself or the entity(ies) associated with your New Relic account (collectively referred to herein as “you” or “your”) as of your date of first use of the Pre-Release Service(s) (the “Effective Date”), which means that your choice to use the Pre-Release Service(s) means that you have the legal authority to use the Pre-Release Service(s) personally or on behalf of the company or organization associated with your New Relic account in accordance with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully as your use of Pre-Release Service(s) may have unintended consequences and materially impact your data or use of the New Relic services and products. If you do not agree to this Policy, your sole remedy is to not make use of the Pre-Release Services. 1. Introduction This Policy and any New Relic technical guides and documentation made available with the Pre-Release Service(s) or from the dedicated ‘Documentation’ page of the New Relic website (the “Documentation”) enables you to test experimental features and products before they are made generally available. New Relic reserves the right to withhold or discontinue any Pre-Release Service(s), which may be designated as an alpha, beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, technology preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description, in its sole discretion and provides no guarantee that any Pre-Release Service(s) will eventually be made commercially or generally available. Pre-Release Service(s) are versions provided before they are generally available and may have bugs, stability issues, or other problems. Use of the Pre-Release Service(s) may result in unexpected results, loss of data, outages, or other damage to your systems or networks. New Relic advises against using the Pre-Release Service(s) in production. No support is offered with or for Pre-Release Service(s). You hereby release New Relic from any liability arising from or related to your use of the Pre-Release Service(s).

The Pre-Release Services and any related information, including without limitation features, functionality, designs, user interface, capabilities, specifications, architectural diagrams, usage data, APIs, deployment schedules, email lists, bug databases, know how, source code, potential features, Feedback, and information related to any business or technical information of New Relic, including without limitation product plans, costs, prices, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, research, development, and negotiations are considered confidential information of New Relic (“Confidential Information”). 2. License and Restrictions 2.1 Evaluation License. Subject to your compliance with the Policy, New Relic hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, during the term of this Policy, to use the Pre-Release Service(s) in accordance with the Documentation solely for the purpose of internal evaluation and supplying Feedback to New Relic. 2.2 License Restrictions.

You acknowledge and agree that you should not rely on the Pre-Release Service(s) for any reason. You further acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting all data and information that is stored, retrieved, or otherwise processed by the Pre-Release Service(s) in accordance with your contractual obligations and requirements under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, you are responsible for all costs and expenses required to backup and restore any data and information that is lost or corrupted as a result of your use of the Pre-Release Service(s) or any Unintended Effects. You understand and agree that your Data may be transferred to the United States for storage, processing, and use by New Relic to provide the Pre-Release Service(s). For any data that you process using the Pre-Release Service(s), you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and consent to do so. New Relic has no obligation to store any data you process using the Pre-Release Service(s) and shall have no liability for the deletion or accuracy of such data. 4.3 Warranty Disclaimers. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF THE COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NEW RELIC MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR SECURE. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 4.4 Modifications. New Relic may change the Policy from time to time as our business changes and technology evolves, and future versions of our generally available services may not be compatible with Pre-Release Service(s) built using previous versions. The most current version of this Policy will be posted in the Documentation. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately for all users in instances to comply with applicable law, for new users of a Pre-Release Service(s) and, for all other users, any changes to this Policy will be effective as of fifteen (15) days after posting notice of such changes. If we determine in our sole discretion that an update is material, we will provide notice of such material change to you through your New Relic account, the Pre-Release Service(s), the Documentation, our blogs or community forums, and/or by email to the email address of your account administrator. We may require you to provide consent to the updated Policy in a specified manner before further use of the Pre-Release Service(s) is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s), your sole remedy is to stop using the Pre-Release Service(s) and any such termination by you shall be without penalty except as specified in this Policy. Otherwise, your use of any Pre-Release Service(s) after any such update shall constitute acceptance of the then-current Policy. 5. Limitation of Liability TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Export Restrictions You acknowledge that the software in the Pre-Release Service(s) licensed hereunder may be subject to the export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. You agree that you will not export or re-export the Pre-Release Service(s), any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct product of the Pre-Release Service(s) to any country, person or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions. 8.

This Policy is effective on behalf of yourself or the entity(ies) associated with your New Relic account (collectively referred to herein as “you” or “your”) as of your date of first use of the Pre-Release Service(s) (the “Effective Date”), which means that your choice to use the Pre-Release Service(s) means that you have the legal authority to use the Pre-Release Service(s) personally or on behalf of the company or organization associated with your New Relic account in accordance with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully as your use of Pre-Release Service(s) may have unintended consequences and materially impact your data or use of the New Relic services and products. If you do not agree to this Policy, your sole remedy is to not make use of the Pre-Release Services. 1. Introduction This Policy and any New Relic technical guides and documentation made available with the Pre-Release Service(s) or from the dedicated ‘Documentation’ page of the New Relic website (the “Documentation”) enables you to test experimental features and products before they are made generally available. New Relic reserves the right to withhold or discontinue any Pre-Release Service(s), which may be designated as an alpha, beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, technology preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description, in its sole discretion and provides no guarantee that any Pre-Release Service(s) will eventually be made commercially or generally available. Pre-Release Service(s) are versions provided before they are generally available and may have bugs, stability issues, or other problems. Use of the Pre-Release Service(s) may result in unexpected results, loss of data, outages, or other damage to your systems or networks. New Relic advises against using the Pre-Release Service(s) in production. No support is offered with or for Pre-Release Service(s). You hereby release New Relic from any liability arising from or related to your use of the Pre-Release Service(s). In connection with your use of the Pre-Release Services, you may provide feedback, comments, and/or suggestions based on or relating to the Pre-Release Services (“Feedback”). The Pre-Release Services and any related information, including without limitation features, functionality, designs, user interface, capabilities, specifications, architectural diagrams, usage data, APIs, deployment schedules, email lists, bug databases, know how, source code, potential features, Feedback, and information related to any business or technical information of New Relic, including without limitation product plans, costs, prices, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, research, development, and negotiations are considered confidential information of New Relic (“Confidential Information”). 2. License and Restrictions 2.1 Evaluation License. Subject to your compliance with the Policy, New Relic hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, during the term of this Policy, to use the Pre-Release Service(s) in accordance with the Documentation solely for the purpose of internal evaluation and supplying Feedback to New Relic. 2.2 License Restrictions.

You acknowledge and agree that, as between you and New Relic, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Pre-Release Service(s), Confidential Information, and Feedback, including but not limited to all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein.

You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of New Relic. You hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to New Relic all right, title, and interest in all Feedback, including but not limited to all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. 3.

You understand and agree that your Data may be transferred to the United States for storage, processing, and use by New Relic to provide the Pre-Release Service(s). For any data that you process using the Pre-Release Service(s), you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and consent to do so.

NEW RELIC MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR SECURE. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 4.4 Modifications. New Relic may change the Policy from time to time as our business changes and technology evolves, and future versions of our generally available services may not be compatible with Pre-Release Service(s) built using previous versions. The most current version of this Policy will be posted in the Documentation. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately for all users in instances to comply with applicable law, for new users of a Pre-Release Service(s) and, for all other users, any changes to this Policy will be effective as of fifteen (15) days after posting notice of such changes. If we determine in our sole discretion that an update is material, we will provide notice of such material change to you through your New Relic account, the Pre-Release Service(s), the Documentation, our blogs or community forums, and/or by email to the email address of your account administrator. We may require you to provide consent to the updated Policy in a specified manner before further use of the Pre-Release Service(s) is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s), your sole remedy is to stop using the Pre-Release Service(s) and any such termination by you shall be without penalty except as specified in this Policy. Otherwise, your use of any Pre-Release Service(s) after any such update shall constitute acceptance of the then-current Policy. 5.

Export Restrictions You acknowledge that the software in the Pre-Release Service(s) licensed hereunder may be subject to the export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. You agree that you will not export or re-export the Pre-Release Service(s), any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct product of the Pre-Release Service(s) to any country, person or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions. 8.

Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

      "body": "The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription. New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as February 19, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the New Relic One - Standard User (Full Stack Observability Standard) Product, you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms.",
