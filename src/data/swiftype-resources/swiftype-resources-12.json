Our integration allows you to track how costs evolve for each billing period and detect unexpected trends, or alert on accumulated costs for the current billing period. Activate integration Follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can: Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more. Go from high level views down to the most granular data. vSphere data visualized in a New Relic dashboard includes operating systems, status, average CPU and memory consumption, and more. Our integration uses the vSphere API to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent. Why it matters With our vSphere integration you can: Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account. Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags. Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards. Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators. Set alerts based on any metrics collected from vCenter. Create workloads to group resources and focus on key data. You can create workloads using data collected via the vSphere integration. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent installed on a host vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the propagate to children option checked Important Large environments: In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file: EVENTS: true and METRICS: true Copy Install and activate To install the vSphere integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-vsphere. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-vsphere MSI installer image from: download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-vsphere/nri-vsphere-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-vsphere-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Copy Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Tarball installation (advanced) You can also install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To configure the vSphere integration, you must define the URL of the vSphere API endpoint, and your vSphere username and password. For configuration examples, see the sample configuration files. Some vSphere integration features are optional and can be enabled via configuration settings. In addition, with secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. Enable and configure performance metrics (Beta) Performance metrics provide a better understanding of the current status of VMware resources and can be collected in addition to the metrics collected by default;and included in the samples;described at the bottom of the page. All metrics collected are included in the corresponding sample with the perf. prefix attached to the name. For example, net.packetsRx.summation is collected and sent as perf.net.packetsRx.summation. To collect vSphere performance metrics, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS environment variable. Data is collected according to the settings in the vsphere-performance.metrics configuration file. You can override the location of the performance metrics config file using PERF_METRIC_FILE environment variable. Notice that the integration follows VMware's data collection levels (1 to 4). When ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS is set, all level 1 metrics are collected. The data collection level of the performance metrics collected can be modified using PERF_LEVEL. Each metric in the config file can be commented out and new ones can be added if needed. Caution Collection of performance data can increase the load in vCenter and the time needed by to collect data. We recommended to only include the metrics you need in the configuration file. To fine-tune data collection, the number of entities and metrics retrieved per request can be modified using BATCH_SIZE_PERF_ENTITIES and BATCH_SIZE_PERF_METRICS. Tip For more information on vSphere performance metrics, see the VMware documentation. Collect vSphere events (Beta) To collect vSphere events, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_EVENTS environment variable. The integration collects events between the current time and the last fetched event for each datacenter. It stores the information regarding the last fetched event in a cache that is updated after each execution. Events are only available if the integration is connected to a vCenter and not directly to an ESXi host. The number of events collected per request can be tuned by modifying EVENTS_PAGE_SIZE, which is set to 100 by default. Events are available in the Events page and can be queried via NRQL as InfrastructureEvent under vSphereEvent. Here is an example of vSphere events data: \"summary\": \"User dcui@127.0.0.1 logged out (login time: Tuesday, 14 July, 2020 08:32:09 AM, number of API invocations: 0, user agent: VMware-client/6.5.0)\", \"vSphereEvent.computeResource\": \"cluster1\", \"vSphereEvent.datacenter\": \"Prod Datacenter\", \"vSphereEvent.date\": \"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:03:51 UTC\", \"vSphereEvent.host\": \"192.168.0.230\", \"vSphereEvent.userName\": \"dcui\" Copy Collect snapshots data (Beta) To collect snapshot data, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_SNAPSHOTS environment variable. Snapshot data can be found in VSphereSnapshotVmSample. Collected data covers total and unique space occupied by disk and memory files, snapshot tree, and creation time. You can use this information to create NRQL queries, dashboards, and alerts, since it's linked to the corresponding virtual machine entity. Collect vSphere tags (Beta) To collect vSphere tags, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable. Tags are available as attributes in the corresponding entity sample as label.tagCategory:tagName. If two tags of the same category are assigned to a resource, they are added to a unique attribute separated by a pipe character. For example: label.tagCategory:tagName|tagName2. Tags can be used to run NRQL queries, filter entities in the New Relic Explorer, and to create dashboards and alerts. Filter resources by tags (Beta) Resource filtering allows you to specify which resources you want to monitor by declaring a set of tags that resources must have in order to be monitored. Resources require a match on any (one or more) of the filter tags in order to be included. If none of the resource tags match any of the filter tags, no information about that resource is sent to New Relic. To use filtering resources by tag you need to have the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable enabled. A tag filter expression is a space-separated list of pairs of strings with the format category=name. For example, to only retrieve resources with a tag category region and include regions us and eu use a filter expression like: region=us region=eu INCLUDE_TAGS: > region=us region=eu Copy To enable resource filtering by tag, edit your integration configuration file and add the option INCLUDE_TAGS with the filter expression you want. Caution Note that datacenter resources acting as the root of the resource tree MUST have tags attached AND match the filter expression in order for other child resources to be fetched. Important If you connect the integration directly to the ESXi host, vCenter data is not available (for example, events, tags, or datacenter metadata). Example configuration Here are examples of the vSphere integration configuration, including performance metrics: vsphere-config.yml.sample (Linux) vsphere-win-config.yml.sample (Windows) vsphere-performance.metrics (Performance metrics) For more information, see our documentation about the general structure of on-host integration configurations. Important The configuration option inventory_source is not compatible with this integration. Update your integration On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. View and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. vSphere data is attached to these event types: VSphereHostSample VSphereClusterSample VSphereVmSample VSphereDatastoreSample VSphereDatacenterSample VSphereResourcePoolSample VSphereSnapshotVmSample Performance data is enabled and configured separately (see Enable and configure performance metrics). For more on how to view and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The vSphere integration provides metric data attached to the following New Relic events: VSphereHost VSphereVm VSphereDatastore VSphereDatacenter VSphereResourcePool VSphereCluster VSphereSnapshotVm VSphereHost Name Description cpu.totalMHz Sum of the MHz for all the individual cores on the host cpu.coreMHz Speed of the CPU cores cpu.available Amount of free CPU MHz in the host cpu.overallUsage CPU usage across all cores on the host in MHz cpu.percent Percentage of CPU utilization in the host cpu.cores Number of physical CPU cores on the host. Physical CPU cores are the processors contained by a CPU package cpu.threads Number of physical CPU threads on the host disk.totalMiB Total capacity of disks mounted in host, in MiB mem.free Amount of available memory in the host, in MiB mem.usage Amount of used memory in the host, in MiB mem.size Total memory capacity of the host, in MiB vmCount Number of virtual machines in the host hypervisorHostname Name of the host uuid The hardware BIOS identification datacenterName Name of the datacenter related to the host clusterName Name of the cluster related to the host resourcePoolNameList List of names of the resource pools related to the host datastoreNameList List of names of datastores related to the host datacenterLocation Datacenter location networkNameList List of names of networks related to the host overallStatus gray: Status is unknown green: Entity is OK yellow: Entity might have a problem red: Entity definitely has a problem connectionState The host connection state: connected: Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is the default setting. disconnected: The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged. notResponding: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server. The state automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. inMaintenanceMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in maintenance mode. This flag is set when the host has entered the maintenance mode. It is not set during the entering phase of maintenance mode. inQuarantineMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in quarantine mode. InfraUpdateHa will recommend to set this flag based on the HealthUpdates received by the HealthUpdateProviders configured for the cluster. A host that is reported as degraded will be recommended to enter quarantine mode, while a host that is reported as healthy will be recommended to exit quarantine mode. Execution of these recommended actions will set this flag. Hosts in quarantine mode will be avoided by vSphere DRS as long as the increased consolidation in the cluster does not negatively affect VM performance. powerState The host power state: poweredOff: The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. poweredOn: The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state. standBy: The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user or automatically by DPM. This state is not a certain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode s also in this state. unknown: If the host is disconnected or notResponding, we know its power state, so the host is marked as unknown. standbyMode The host’s standby mode. The property is only populated by vCenter server. If queried directly from the ESX host, the property is unset. entering: The host is entering standby mode. exiting: The host is exiting standby mode. in: The host is in standby mode. none: The host is not in standby mode, and it is not in the process of entering or exiting standby mode. cryptoState Encryption state of the host. Valid values are enumerated by the CryptoState type: incapable: The host is not safe for receiving sensitive material. prepared: The host is prepared for receiving sensitive material but does not have a host key set yet. safe: The host is crypto safe and has a host key set. bootTime The time when the host was booted.

Our integration allows you to track how costs evolve for each billing period and detect unexpected trends, or alert on accumulated costs for the current billing period. Activate integration Follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic. In some cases, the Azure Cost Management integration requires you to add an additional role to fetch billing data: In the Azure Portal Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor.

      "body": "Navigation for docs.newrelic.com is stored in YAML files located in the /src/nav/ directory. Each top-level navigation should have its own configuration file. You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the develop branch. The configuration file As an example, here's a snippet of the agents.yml navigation configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. Be sure to imitate the same spacing when you make changes: title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions. The config files from the old integrations will not be deleted, so you won’t have to configure them again. Uninstall package Package manager Uninstall instructions apt (Debian or Ubuntu) sudo apt-get remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo apt-get autoremove yum (Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL) sudo yum remove newrelic-infra-integrations sudo yum autoremove zypper (SLES) sudo zypper -n remove newrelic-infra-integrations --clean-deps Copy Install your integrations one by one following these instructions. To replicate the integrations package, you will need to install all the available integrations again.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Tip To use dashboards and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. This includes the dashboards you've created within the New Relic One platform as well as the dashboards built in Insights. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By cloning an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Clone a dashboard Clone any dashboard by clicking the Clone dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can clone any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you clone a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the clone will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your cloned dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can clone it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by cloning another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Metrics Explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is powerful because of its flexibility, but this flexibility can be overwhelming as you consider ways to implement it. Here are some architectural recipes to give you you some context as you explore OpenTelemetry. Vendor-neutral option Use this recipe if you don’t want to add any vendor-specific code to your applications. As a best practice to maximize value and interoperability, we recommend the OpenTelemetry collector as the main ingredient of this recipe. The OpenTelemetry collector proxies data between instrumented code and backend services. Tip We have a pre-release program that allows you to use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. The OpenTelemetry collector has one or more pipelines. Each pipeline includes: A receiver that accepts telemetry data coming from instrumentation. Zero or more processors that perform computations or mutations on the telemetry data. One or more exporters that send telemetry data downstream. New Relic (along with many other community members) contributes its exporter to the opentelemetry-collector-contrib project. You can enable and configure the exporters in this project without changing instrumented code. Some example exporters are: The New Relic exporter that sends metric and trace data to New Relic. A logging exporter that logs every data point to STDOUT. A Prometheus exporter that exposes a Prometheus endpoint to be scraped by a downstream Prometheus system. The OpenTelemetry Collector (with exporters) is available as a pre-built docker image. Two common collector deployments are the standalone service and sidecar. We cover them briefly here, but if you need more detail, see the OpenTelemetry documentation. Standalone Service When you set up the collector as a standalone service, OpenTelemetry calls this a gateway: Sidecar/Daemon/Agent If you set up the collector as a sidecar, OpenTelemetry calls this an agent: Tail-based sampling By default, OpenTelemetry uses head-based sampling, which means traces are randomly sampled up front before details about the completed traces are known. As an alternative, you can configure OpenTelemetry to use tail-based sampling, which analyzes all your traces after they're completed. Infinite Tracing with the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) If you want to use tail-based sampling, set up the collector to send every span to a trace observer in New Relic Edge where they're analyzed. For more information about this option for tail-based sampling, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. In this approach, the collector and the trace observer handle the data before it's sent to New Relic: Use the Tail Sampling Processor with the OpenTelemetry collector Another option for tail-based sampling is to configure the OpenTelemetry collector to use the Tail Sampling Processor to sample traces prior to sending to New Relic.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic.

View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint.

To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release).

View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights.

Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing.

C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here.

If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

Because it has not yet reached 1.0 for any language, the OpenTelemetry SDK, APIs, and instrumentation are subject to change. If you're using New Relic's OpenTelemetry exporter, but you're not seeing the data you expect, this guide should help. OpenTelemetry currently supports two telemetry types: distributed traces and metrics. Through the New Relic UI, you can see your traces and metrics, as well as a view that focuses on errors. Learn more about how to find your data. Install To send your data through the OpenTelemetry collector, configure your OpenTelemetry SDK service.name as a resource and configure the SDK to send data to the collector. Then configure the collector with the New Relic exporter with your Insert API key. Consult the collector documentation if you're having trouble sending data through the collector. Once OpenTelemetry is configured with the API key and service name, you should be able to find your service in the explorer. Select your service to view its summary page. Traces When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Distributed tracing to see distributed traces. If you don’t see traces: Ensure your service was reporting during the time window. Ensure you've added OpenTelemetry API calls to create trace spans. If you're using OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, ensure the instrumentation supports the libraries and frameworks you're using. Traces are the most mature telemetry type in OpenTelemetry, so you'll find the richest performance information from traces. Trace sampling Our trace UI will only reflect the data sent to us. This means that throughput and other counts may not reflect the unsampled data. You can configure sampling application-side using the OpenTelemetry SDKs. If you enable our Infinite Tracing feature, you have the option to send us all of your trace data and use New Relic sampling. Note that New Relic may rate-limit trace data. Metrics When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Metrics explorer to visualize metrics and create dashboards. If you don’t see metrics, you may need to add OpenTelemetry API calls to add the metrics that you care about. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for metric naming is still being defined and to date most instrumentation includes trace spans but not metrics. We expect that more instrumentation will include metrics in the coming months. Errors When viewing your OpenTelemetry data, on the left side of the UI you can select Errors to understand what errors your service is generating. The count of errors is based on how many traces have a span with the attribute error.stack. If you don’t see the errors listed that you expect to see, check that your instrumentation sets the following three attributes: error.stack error.msg error.type In order for the error to be listed, a span must have an attribute that starts with error. Caution The OpenTelemetry standard for representing errors in traces and metrics is still being defined so these attribute names are subject to change. We expect the specification to be frozen very soon.",

Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Configuration file options When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the .yml configuration file can have the following properties: Key Required? Description title yes The text that is shown in the navigation. path * no The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes. * Adding a path is required to generate auto index page content. See path requirements below. children no Any sub-navigation nodes. When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate .yml file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages. Tip Each category has its own index.md page (list of pages for that category). When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to reflect the new information architecture more correctly. Use nav YAML to generate auto index content On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in src/content that does not already have an index.mdx file and that has at least one .mdx or .md file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav YAML file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content. If an index page path is in more than one nav YAML file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path. Nav requirements for auto index pages In order to populate the auto index page with nav YAML data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav YAML file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the <IndexContents /> component know which section to display on the index page itself. Each nav item must reference a directory path in src/content that contains at least one .md or .mdx file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it). Example If this auto index page is used in full-stack-observability.yml and integrations.yml, we will attach the integrations.yml nav to it because: the top level path in the integrations.yml matches the beginning of the auto index page path: title: Integrations path: /docs/integrations Copy matches this auto index page path: /docs/integrations /amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list Copy",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Open one.newrelic.com, and go to explorer. Using the filter bar at the top, narrow your searches: Limit results to OpenTelemetry entities with the following: After the OpenTelemetry filter, you can add another filter for your service based on the service.name attributes you've used. For example, to find CartService: Click the service you want to know more about, and if you need help understanding the data, see the explanations below. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed Tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in the response time of your application. From the transaction summary page, you can get a list of transactions by selecting See transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On this page, you can see total errors, as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file.

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Use the example configuration file, or look at the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file, which includes the nri-prometheus-cfg config map and an example configuration. Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Docker container. Add the endpoints to scrape; for example, add the http://localhost:8080/metrics endpoint to collect metrics about the integration itself. Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Start the integration in the background: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:1.5 Copy Confirm the container is running properly: docker ps -f \"name=nri-prometheus\" Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Kubernetes installation Important To prevent your data from being duplicated, configure your New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration only with one replica. Running two or more replicas will result in duplicated data. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures for restarts and gaps in data. To install the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration in a Kubernetes environment: Download the integration manifest .yaml file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy Edit the nri-prometheus-latest.yaml manifest file: Required: Add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. env: - name: LICENSE_KEY value: \"<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>\" [...] config.yaml: | cluster_name: \"<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>\" Copy Specify which metrics you want to ignore or include according to the prefixes for the metrics and labels. By default, the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration uses the same labels as Prometheus to discover targets. For more information, see the metrics filtering documentation. Deploy the integration in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f nri-prometheus-latest.yaml Copy To confirm that the deployment has been created successfully, look at the CURRENT replicas in the results generated by this command: kubectl get deployments nri-prometheus Copy Confirm that the integration has been configured correctly: Wait a few minutes, then go to the New Relic UI, and run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: FROM Metric SELECT count(*) WHERE clusterName = 'YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME' since 1 hour ago Copy Update the integration To update the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, follow the procedures for Docker or Kubernetes as applicable: Docker update procedures Remove the Docker container. Follow standard installation procedures to start a new Docker container. The integration logs its current version when it starts up. To determine the running version: docker logs nri-prometheus 2>&1 | grep \"Integration version\" Copy Example output: time=\"2019-02-26T09:21:21Z\" level=info msg=\"Starting New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration version 1.0.0 \" Copy Kubernetes update procedures Follow standard installation procedures.

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

      "body": "This resource contains information about common errors and error messages that may alert you to issues with data visibility and availability, as well as information about how to respond. Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "If you are using our Prometheus remote write integration in a high-availability (HA) configuration, you need to make sure your Prometheus servers aren't sending multiple copies of the same metrics to New Relic. This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "To query and visualize the metrics collected for your Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration with New Relic, you can use NRQL. You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed. To view the number of connected Redis clients per pod in the default namespace: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE namespaceName='default' FACET podName TIMESERIES Copy Docker: View average memory free for scraped endpoints This example assumes you are scraping node exporters for Docker and want to use OpenMetrics. To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped.

The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter.

For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of.

PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries.

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of.

PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\".

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Tip Owner or Admins Follow these instructions to install and configure New Relic Mobile functionality with your tvOS applications. Tip tvOS apps using Cocoapods have separate installation procedures. Installing your tvOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app From the Get Started page, select tvOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic Mobile. To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile, then select See Instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing tvOS installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app) > Settings > Installation. Configuring your tvOS application These procedures to configure your tvOS app also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. Download and unzip the tvOS SDK for New Relic Mobile. To add the New Relic tvOS Mobile Framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your Project in the Project Navigator window. Follow the prompts to copy items into destination and to create folder references. Add the SystemConfiguration.framework, libc++.tbd, and libz.tbd libraries to your Linker settings. To start the agent: Import the New Relic Mobile Agent header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add + [ NewRelic startWithApplicationToken: < appToken>] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases and paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device.

The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions.

We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type.

It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API.

Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API.

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings.

New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type.

It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API.

Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type.

It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API.

Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system.

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.
