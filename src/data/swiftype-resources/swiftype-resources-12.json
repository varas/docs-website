Features New Relic gathers data from the Azure Database for MariaDB service, which provides a fully managed, enterprise-ready database as a service. MariaDB provides predictable performance and scalability for applications using open-source tools and platforms. Using New Relic, you can: View Azure Database for MariaDB data in pre-built dashboards. Run custom queries and visualize the data in New Relic One. Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data. Activate integration Follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic Infrastructure, using the generic Reader role. Configuration and polling New Relic queries your Azure Database services according to a default polling interval, which varies depending on the integration.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Here's what the automated installer does: Asks for the cluster name and namespace of the integration. Asks for additional setup options, such as Kube state metrics. Asks for the installation method: manifest file or Helm. Generates either the manifest or Helm chart. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's integrations include an integration for reporting your Microsoft Azure Database for MariaDB metrics and inventory data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate the integration and describes the data reported. Features New Relic gathers data from the Azure Database for MariaDB service, which provides a fully managed, enterprise-ready database as a service. MariaDB provides predictable performance and scalability for applications using open-source tools and platforms. Using New Relic, you can: View Azure Database for MariaDB data in pre-built dashboards. Run custom queries and visualize the data in New Relic One. Create alert conditions to notify you of changes in data. Activate integration Follow standard procedures to activate your Azure service in New Relic Infrastructure, using the generic Reader role. Configuration and polling New Relic queries your Azure Database services according to a default polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. For Azure Database for PostgreSQL integrations: Polling interval: 5 minutes (maximum recommended polling frequency: 1 hour) Resolution: 1 data point per minute You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. View and use data To explore your integration data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > (select an integration). In New Relic, data about a single database is attached to the AzureMariaDbServerSample event type, with a provider value of AzureMariaDbServer. Metric data This integration collects the following metric data. Database sample metrics Metric Description activeConnections Count of active connections. backupStorageUsedBytes Backup storage used, in bytes. connectionsFailed Count of failed connections. cpuPercent Percentage of CPU used. ioConsumptionPercent Percentage of I/O consumption used. memoryPercent Percentage of memory used. networkEgressBytes Network Out across active connections, in bytes. networkIngressBytes Network In across active connections, in bytes. secondsBehindMaster Replication lag, in seconds. serverlogStorageLimitBytes Server log storage limit, in bytes. serverlogStoragePercent Percentage of server log storage used. serverlogStorageUsageBytes Server log storage used, in bytes. storageLimitBytes Amount of storage available, in bytes. storagePercent Percentage of available storage used. storageUsedBytes Amount of storage used, in bytes. Inventory data This integration collects the following inventory data about your system's state and configuration.

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes.

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "Our Microsoft SQL Server integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MS SQL Server environment to our platform, where you can see the health of your MS SQL Server environment. We collect both database and instance-level metrics so that you can pinpoint the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 SP3 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Windows distribution compatible with the infrastructure agent. Microsoft SQL Server user or Domain user with user privileges for both CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE, and READ access permissions. Quick start Instrument your MS SQL Server environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Microsoft SQL Server integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MS SQL Server environment. Microsoft SQL users and privileges In the Microsoft SQL Server that is to be monitored, execute the following script to create a new user and grant CONNECT, VIEW SERVER STATE, and read access permissions to that user. See the Microsoft documentation for details on creating logins and users in Microsoft SQL Server. Use the following statements to create a new login and to grant CONNECT and VIEW SERVER STATE permissions to the login. USE master; CREATE LOGIN newrelic WITH PASSWORD = 'tmp_password'; --insert new password here GRANT CONNECT SQL TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO newrelic; GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO newrelic; Copy Use the following statements to grant read access privileges to the user. DECLARE @name SYSNAME DECLARE db_cursor CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY FOR SELECT NAME FROM master.sys.databases WHERE NAME NOT IN ('master','msdb','tempdb','model','rdsadmin','distribution') OPEN db_cursor FETCH NEXT FROM db_cursor INTO @name WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN EXECUTE('USE \"' + @name + '\"; CREATE USER newrelic FOR LOGIN newrelic;' ); FETCH next FROM db_cursor INTO @name END CLOSE db_cursor DEALLOCATE db_cursor Copy Run the following command to verify that the user was successfully created. sqlcmd -U user_name -S host_name Copy Install and activate To install the Microsoft SQL Server integration: Download the latest .MSI installer image from: 32-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/386/nri-mssql-386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mssql/nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy In an admin account, run the install script using an absolute path. 32-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd386.msi Copy 64-bit Windows msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mssql-amd64.msi Copy Rename C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\mssql-config.yml.sample to mssql-config.yml, and edit according to your instance. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example configuration, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The mssql-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metric data from the Microsoft SQL Server environment. Arguments The all_data command accepts the following arguments: username: username used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. To use Windows Authentication, specify this argument in the DOMAIN\\username form. This field is required. password: password used to authenticate the MS SQL Server. This field is required. hostname: hostname or IP of the MS SQL Server installation. Default: 127.0.0.1. port: port number on which the MS SQL Server is listening. This is only required when instance is not specified. instance: instance the Microsoft SQL Server is connected to. instance can be used in place of port by enabling SQL Browser; if enabled, do not include port in the argument. enable_ssl: indicates whether SSL is used to connect to the MS SQL Server. Default: false. trust_server_certificate: if set to true, server certificate is not verified for SSL. If set to false, certificate will be verified against supplied certificate. certificate_location: certificate file to verify SSL encryption against. timeout: timeout for queries, in seconds. Default: 30. enable_buffer_metrics: enables the collection of buffer pool metrics. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. enable_database_reserve_metrics: enables the collection of database partition reserve space. These can be resource intensive for large systems. Default: true. custom_metrics_query: an SQL query with the required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value. The metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. Custom queries metrics will be attached to the MssqlCustomQuerySample event type. custom_metrics_config: full path and file name for an external queries YAML file. Use this instead of custom_metrics_query if you need execute multiple custom queries. For an example configuration, see the example config file. extra_connection_url_args: appends additional parameters to connection URL. Ex. 'applicationintent=readonly&foo=bar' Tip If both port and instance are omitted, the default port of 1433 is used. Example configurations Example mssql-config.yml file configuration: Configuration for one query integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_query: >- SELECT 'instance_buffer_pool_size' AS metric_name, Count_big(*) * (8*1024) AS metric_value, 'gauge' as metric_type, database_id FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors WITH (nolock) GROUP BY database_id labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Configuration for multiple queries If you need multiple SQL queries, add them to mssql-custom-query.yml, and then reference that file. integration_name: com.newrelic.mssql instances: - name: mssql-server command: all_data arguments: hostname: mssql.localnet username: mssql_user password: mssql_password port: 1433 custom_metrics_config: full_path_to_file labels: env: production role: mssql Copy Here's an example mssql-custom-query.yml. queries: # Example for metric_name / metric_type specified in this config - query: SELECT count(*) AS 'metric_value' FROM sys.databases metric_name: dbCount metric_type: gauge # Example for metric_name from query, metric_type auto-detected, additional attribute 'category_type' - query: SELECT CONCAT('category_', category_id) AS metric_name, name AS metric_value, category_type FROM syscategories database: msdb # Example for stored procedure 'exec dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2' - query: dbo.sp_server_info @attribute_id = 2 Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API. Learn about Grafana support options. Explore the range of other options available as part of the Telemetry Data Platform.",

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations allow you to report data from specific systems and supplement infrastructure's default, automatic monitoring. The Microsoft Azure integrations report data from various Azure platform services to your New Relic account. This document explains how to activate Azure integrations. Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes. Explore app data in New Relic Infrastructure's UI After you activate an Azure integration, New Relic will start monitoring your Azure data at regular polling intervals. To find and use your data, use the data explorer or go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation.

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above as well as specific versions of Java 8 (specifically version 8u262+), we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. See supported Java versions for full details. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

Understand JVM cluster behavior over time The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across your entire cluster. This timeline enables quicker troubleshooting and issue detection; for example, at a glance you can see: How a recent deployment affected the rest of the JVM cluster When a JVM restarted How an individual instance was affected by its noisy neighbor To make troubleshooting easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select service) > Realtime Profiling Java: The JVM cluster timeline view shows the JVM behavior across the cluster. Each row of the timeline represents a specific JVM over time. Inside each row, a box represents a 5-minute period of that JVM’s life. From least severe to most severe, yellow, orange, and red traffic lights indicate anomalous behavior for a JVM, so you can drill down into that instance and the right time period when investigating errors or other performance issues. Select How is JVM health determined? for a detailed breakdown of how JVM health is calculated.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section.

Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver.

Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

      "body": "You can send OpenTelemetry data to New Relic and analyze the results in our observability platform. This introduction can help you decide if you want to get started with OpenTelemetry. If you're already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to jump into the setup, go to our OpenTelemetry quick start. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can send data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Tip For more, see our blog posts on OpenTelemetry. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start sending data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Here are two basic ways you could set up OpenTelemetry with New Relic: use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended), or use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Each approach assumes you set up instrumentation in your code, but they differ in how the data is gathered and sent to New Relic. If you are interested in tracing, we recommend that you instrument as many services as you can so that you get the most benefit from distributed tracing. There are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Tip We discuss some variations on these basic approaches in our OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. For a detailed discussion about the architecture of OpenTelemetry itself, see our blog. Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. Collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. In this workflow, note the alternate path if you set up New Relic Infinite Tracing: Here are some advantages of this approach: The OpenTelemetry collector can perform processing operations on telemetry data before it is sent to the backend, including filtering attributes, excluding traces, and sampling. The OpenTelemetry collector can receive telemetry data in many formats and forward it on to New Relic’s backend, including Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, AWS X-Ray, OpenCensus, and much more. The OpenTelemetry collector can collect system-level metrics from the host where it is running. OTLP (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector, or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. Here are some advantages to operating without an OpenTelemetry collector: There is no need to deploy a collector alongside your service. Telemetry data is sent directly from the instrumented service to New Relic. If something goes wrong, and telemetry data does not arrive, there is one less component to debug. What's next?

      "body": "New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ > -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"common\": { $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" $ } $ }, $ \"spans\": [ $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"ABC\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"duration.ms\": 12.53, $ \"name\": \"/home\" $ } $ }, $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"DEF\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", $ \"duration.ms\": 2.97, $ \"name\": \"/auth\", $ \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"metrics\": [ $ { $ \"name\": \"memory.heap\", $ \"type\": \"gauge\", $ \"value\": 2.3, $ \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, $ \"attributes\": { $ \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"customerId\": \"xyz\" $ } $ ]' Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic.

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2.

Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Send your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI In the following sections, we explain some basic architectural approaches, but if you want to explore other implementation options, check out OpenTelemetry architecture recipes. Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Make sure you have an Insights insert key to send spans and metrics to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Tip We recommend that you instrument as many services as possible to get the most benefit from distributed tracing. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete the next step of sending your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Send your telemetry data to New Relic Choose how you want to export your telemetry data to New Relic: Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) Both approaches involve configuring your service with an OTLP exporter to send data over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). To do so, follow the documentation of the OTLP exporter for your service's language: C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Important New Relic's language-specific exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of the OpenTelemetry collector and native OTLP endpoint options described here. If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider signing up for the pre-release of New Relic's native OTLP endpoint. If you are interested in tracing, there are two main options for trace sampling: Configure the head-based, native sampling in OpenTelemetry, which means OpenTelemetry samples traces before they are sent to New Relic. Head-based sampling doesn’t analyze all traces, but instead randomly samples traces up front before details about the completed traces are known. Both the OpenTelemetry collector and the native OTLP endpoint support this option. If you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, configure tail-based sampling with New Relic Infinite Tracing, which reroutes traces to our cloud-based trace observer. The trace observer accepts all your traces and sorts through them to find useful ones. If you want to know more about this option, especially if you want to use it in the EU, see Introduction to Infinite Tracing. While Infinite Tracing is not yet compatible with the native OTLP endpoint, it is still possible to configure tail-based sampling via the collector, for more information see Tail Sampling Processor. Use the OpenTelemetry collector (recommended) The OpenTelemetry project provides a tool called the OpenTelemetry Collector that you can deploy and use as an intermediate data aggregator. In your service, you use the OpenTelemetry exporter to send telemetry data first to the OpenTelemetry collector. Then, in the OpenTelemetry collector, you enable the New Relic exporter to send data to New Relic. The diagram below shows the flow of data with the collector. To use the collector: Configure your OpenTelemetry collector to export data to New Relic, using our example as a guide. Important The New Relic exporter for the collector will be deprecated in the future. If you are running your own collector, you will instead be able to use the OpenTelemetry Collector's OTLP exporter When we release our native OTLP endpoint (pre-release), th If you were previously using a New Relic language-specific exporter consider using the OTLP exporter for your language and send data directly to New Relic's native OTLP endpoint (pre-release). Use the native OTLP endpoint (pre-release) The example above uses a New Relic exporter, but we have a pre-release program if you want to try out the native OTLP endpoint for sending your data to New Relic. You can either use the OTLP exporter in the OpenTelemetry collector or send us data directly from your service. If you are interested, let us know by completing this form. You can configure your service's OTLP exporter to send data directly to New Relic. If you're running your own OpenTelemetry collector, you can use the OTLP exporter for the collector to send data to New Relic. Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, you can go to New Relic and view your data. The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.",

      "body": "With New Relic's real-time profiling for Java using Java Flight Recorder (JFR) metrics, you can run continuous, always-on profiling of your Java code in production environments. The accompanying JVM cluster timeline view provides a fast and intuitive way to diagnose cluster-wide performance problems. For example, you can quickly see how an application’s deployment affects the overall health of the cluster. Find performance bottlenecks Troubleshooting performance bottlenecks in your Java application or service can help you better understand the following: Where you’re wasting resources When an incident occurs What happened during an incident What performance issues led up to an incident To make troubleshooting faster and easier, you need to see the high fidelity runtime characteristics of your code running on the JVM, and you need that data in real time. JFR daemon The JFR daemon is an exporter for JFR events which allows you to harness the power of the New Relic One platform for visualizing your JVM's behavior. Using the New Relic Java telemetry SDK as the underlying implementation, the JFR daemon converts JFR events into New Relic telemetry types and reports them to New Relic's metric and event ingest APIs. There are three different usage scenarios for the JFR daemon: New Relic Java agent JFR service (RECOMMENDED) - JFR monitoring built into the flagship New Relic Java agent. No additional setup is needed, simply install the Java agent, make sure that the JFR service is enabled, and JFR data will flow into the same APM application as the Java agent. Requires New Relic Java agent version 7.0.0+. Standalone process - Run the jfr-daemon as a standalone process and configure it to monitor an existing Java process using remote JMX. Standalone Java agent - Attach the jfr-daemon to your Java process as a Java agent. A lightweight alternative to the New Relic Java agent. Supported Java versions While the JFR daemon supports any version of Java 11 and above as well as specific versions of Java 8 (specifically version 8u262+), we don't recommend using any non-LTS version of Java in production environments. See supported Java versions for full details. Requirements and Usage Instructions Requirements and instructions vary for each usage scenario. For full details please see the links for your specific usage scenario: New Relic Java agent JFR service - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone process - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Standalone Java agent - Requirements, configuration, and usage instructions Important Apps running with the JFR daemon should expect the JFR subsystem to use additional memory.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and Mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and Mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in Mobile, Browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the Transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see New Relic data types. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

Tip To use Azure integrations and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Requirements The Azure integration activation process requires you to: Create a New Relic application and key in Azure. Grant this application access to the Azure services you want to monitor. Place required information in the New Relic's Integrations UI. To use these integration activation instructions directly from the Infrastructure UI, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Add an Azure account. Step 1: Get Azure subscription and tenant IDs To get your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId, use your local terminal if you have Azure's tools installed, or use Azure's Cloud Shell terminal in the Azure portal. Open a terminal with access to your Azure account. Type the following: az account show Copy Copy and save the subscription id and tenantID from the output response for later use. The response should look similar to the response below. The subscription id and tenantID are highlighted. @Azure:~$ az account show { \"environmentName\": \"AzureCloud\", \"id\": \"9ffe9512-f4a2-42dd-1230-518aec34be21\" , \"isDefault\": true, \"name\": \"Beyond Team Sandbox\", \"state\": \"Enabled\", \"tenantId\": \"ac6692da-1231-422f-22a8-9eed6dbe83f1\" , \"user\": { \"name\": \"youremail@domain\", \"type\": \"user\" } Copy Step 2: Register your app and get ID You must have Azure permissions to register your application and copy its Application ID. To register your app in Azure: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to the Azure Active Directory. From Manage, select App registrations > New registration. Enter a name for the application. We recommend that you name your app NewRelic-Integrations. In Redirect URI select Weband add https://www.newrelic.com as the sign-on URI. Create the application by clicking Register. From the Overview of your app, copy the Application (client) ID, and save it for later use. Step 3: Create a client secret in Azure To create a client secret associated with your application: In Azure, under the application you've just created, select Certificates & secrets. Under Client secrets, click on New client secret and then on Add. Copy the value of Client Secret and save it for later use. Step 4: Provide permissions to services Your app must provide Reader permissions for each Azure service you want New Relic to monitor: In the Azure Subscriptions section, select the subscriptions that you want New Relic to monitor. Select Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment. From the Role dropdown, select Reader. From the Select dropdown, select the app's name; for example, NewRelic-Integrations. From Selected members, verify your app name appears, then select Save. Some Azure services, including Azure CosmosDB and Azure VMs, require additional steps. See the Azure integration documentation for the services you want to enable. Step 5: Add app to New Relic Now you can activate the Azure integration in the Infrastructure UI. The UI will require the information you have saved in the previous steps, including: Your Azure account's subscription id and tenantId The application's application ID The application's client secret To add your Azure app to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and select the Azure Service you wish to add. Follow the steps in the UI to activate the integration in New Relic. If you have already completed the Azure account steps, skip to the end of the steps to fill out the form. (For Azure account name, enter the name you want to use to identify the account in your Integrations dashboard.) Update application details and rotate client secrets It's possible to update the application's name and authentication credentials using the Infrastructure UI or the Cloud Integrations API at any time. Follow these steps to rotate the Azure client secret in the Infratructure UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure and click on Manage Services on the Azure account you wish to edit. Select the edit action next to Account Name to see and edit any application value. Edit the Client Secret field with the new value and confirm with Save Changes.

      "body": "You can get Prometheus data flowing in New Relic with just a few simple steps. This page covers basic setup for the remote write integration, as well as a few common troubleshooting topics. For information on integrating Prometheus servers in a high availability (HA) configuration, see our Prometheus high availability documentation. Tip To use Prometheus integrations and infrastructure monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

      "body": "This resource contains information about common errors and error messages that may alert you to issues with data visibility and availability, as well as information about how to respond. Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy In order to keep the time needed to scrape all the targets below 30 seconds, use the following configurations: Targets Configuration Targets < 400, with 1000 metrics each No modification is required. CPU ranges roughly between 0.1 and 1.5 cores, and the memory required should be no more than 256MB. 400 < targets < 1000, with 1000 metrics each The number of workers should be increased to 6-8. CPU ranges roughly between 1.5 and 3.5 cores, and the memory required is around 100MB. Targets > 1000, with 1000 metrics each The number of workers should be increased to 10 or more. CPU is over 3.5 cores, and the memory required is around 1GB or more.",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Key name Description cluster_name Required. The name of the cluster. This value will be included as the clusterName attribute for all metrics. verbose Stringified boolean. true (default): Logs debugging information. false: Only logs error messages. targets Configuration of static endpoints to be scraped by the integration. It contains a list of objects. For more information about this structure, see the documentation about target configuration. scrape_enabled_label Kubernetes String. The integration will check if the Kubernetes pod and service are annotated or have a label with this value to decide if it has to be scraped. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the amount of data by ignoring metrics or including specific metrics that are sent to New Relic. Since by default we use the same label Prometheus uses to discover targets that can be scraped, most exporters that you install automatically set this label. To keep a fine-grained control on the targets you want the integration to scrape, you can set this option to some other value (such as newrelic/scrape) and then add the annotation or label newrelic/scrape: \"true\" to your Kubernetes objects. If both are set, annotations take precedence over labels. Default: \"prometheus.io/scrape\" scrape_duration How often should the scraper run. To lower memory usage, increase this value. To raise memory usage, decrease this value. The impact on memory usage is due to distributing target fetching over the scrape interval to avoid querying (and buffering) all the data at once. Default is 30s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. scrape_timeout The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints. Default: 5s. Valid values include 1s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, etc. worker_threads Number of worker threads used for scraping targets. Can be increased on environments with a high number of targets or targets with high latency, but might increase memory consumption. Default: 4. It is not recommended to use more than 10. require_scrape_enabled_label_for_nodes Kubernetes Whether or not Kubernetes nodes need labels to be scraped. Default: true. percentiles Histogram support is based on New Relic's guidelines for higher level metrics abstractions. To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. Valid values include 50, 95, and 99. emitter_proxy Proxy used by the integration when submitting metrics: [scheme]://[domain]:[port] This proxy won't be used when fetching metrics from the targets. By default this is empty, and no proxy will be used. emitter_ca_file Certificate to add to the root CA that the emitter will use when verifying server certificates. If left empty, TLS uses the host's root CA set. emitter_insecure_skip_verify Whether the emitter should skip TLS verification when submitting data. Default: false. disable_autodiscovery Set to true in order to disable autodiscovery in the k8s cluster. It can be useful when running the Pod with a service account having limited privileges. Default: false. Configure objects in target key If you want the target key in the configuration file to contain one or more objects, use the following structure in the YAML list: Key name Description description A description for the URLs in this target. urls A list of strings with the URLs to be scraped. tls_config Authentication configuration used to send requests. It supports TLS and Mutual TLS. For more information, see the documentation about mutual TLS authentication. Kubernetes port and endpoint path New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration automatically discovers which targets to scrape. To specify the port and endpoint path to be used when constructing the target, you can use the prometheus.io/port and prometheus.io/path annotations or label in your Kubernetes pods and services. Annotations take precedence over labels. If prometheus.io/port is not present, the integration will try to scrape each port or ContainerPort defined for the service. If prometheus.io/path is not present, the integration will default to /metrics. If a service is not running on the default /my-metrics-path path, add a label to the pod prometheus.io/path=my-metrics-path. If the path to the metrics endpoint is more complex and cannot be a valid label value (for example, foo/bar), use annotations instead. Example: Labels for Kubernetes port and path In this example, you have a deployment in your cluster, and the pods expose Prometheus metrics on port 8080 and in the path my-metrics. In the PodSpec metadata of the deployment manifest, set the labels prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" and prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\". When the integration tries to retrieve the metrics from your pods, it will send a request to http://<pod-ip>:8080/my-metrics. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: my-app template: metadata: labels: app: my-app prometheus.io/scrape: \"true\" prometheus.io/port: \"8080\" prometheus.io/path: \"my-metrics\" Copy Services and Endpoints scrape behaviour By default, services are scraped directly instead of the underlying endpoints since scrape_services is set to true and scrape_endpoints to false. In order to change this behaviour set scrape_endpoints to true configuring Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations to scrape the underlying endpoints, as Prometheus server natively does, instead of directly the services. Please notice that depending on the number of endpoints behind the services in the cluster the load and the data injested can increase considerably, monitor and, if needed, increase resource requirements. Moreover, even if it is possible to set both scrape_services and scrape_endpoints to true to assure retrocompatibility, it would lead to duplicate data. Reload the configuration The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration does not automatically reload the configuration when you make changes to the configuration file. Docker: To reload the configuration, restart the container running the integration: docker restart nri-prometheus Copy Kubernetes: To reload the configuration, restart the integration. Recommendation: Scale the deployment down to zero replicas, and then scale it back to one replica: kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment nri-prometheus --replicas=1 Copy Docker: Run previous config file Docker: To run the integration with the previous configuration file: Copy the content and save it to a config.yaml file. From within the same directory, run the command: docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name nri-prometheus \\ -e CLUSTER_NAME=\"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" \\ -e LICENSE_KEY=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" \\ -v \"$(pwd)/config.yaml:/config.yaml\" \\ newrelic/nri-prometheus:latest --configfile=/config.yaml Copy",

Set up the integration Go to the Prometheus remote write setup launcher in New Relic One, then complete these steps. Add Prometheus data Enter a name for the Prometheus server to be connected and your remote_write URL. Important: The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data. It will also be the name that identifies which Prometheus server is sending data to New Relic. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. Add this information under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section. Use the following syntax: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy OR remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME Copy European Union accounts: If you're connecting from the EU, use the following URL: https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write Copy Kubernetes and Helm remote write integrations: Add the remote write URL to your Helm values.yaml file. Replace remoteWrite: [] with two lines similar to the following example. Be sure to use your remote write URL and use indentation that matches the rest of the file: remoteWrite: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME bearer_token:YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Restart your Prometheus server. View your data in the New Relic UI. For example, use the remote write dashboard we automatically create when you set up your integration. Mapping of Prometheus metric types The Prometheus remote write protocol does not include metric type information or other helpful metric metadata when sending metrics to New Relic. Because the remote write protocol doesn't include this information, New Relic infers the metric type based on Prometheus naming conventions. Metrics not following these naming conventions may not be mapped correctly. New Relic maps Prometheus metrics types into New Relic metric types based on Prometheus metric naming conventions as follows: metricName_bucket is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_count is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_total is stored as a New Relic count metric type. metricName_sum is stored as a New Relic summary metric type. Everything else is stored as a New Relic gauge metric type. Override metric type mappings If you have metrics that don't follow Prometheus naming conventions, you can configure remote-write to tag the metric with a newrelic_metric_type label that indicates the metric type. This label is stripped when received by New Relic. Example: You have a counter metric named my_counter, which does not have our naming convention suffix of _bucket, _count or _total. In this situation, your metric would be identified as a gauge rather than a counter. To correct this, add the following relabel configuration to your prometheus.yml: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?X-License-Key=... write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: ^my_counter$ target_label: newrelic_metric_type replacement: \"counter\" action: replace Copy This rule matches any metric with the name my_counter and adds a newrelic_metric_type label that identifies it as a counter. You can use the following (case sensitive) values as the replacement value: counter gauge summary When a newrelic_metric_type label is present on a metric received and set to one of the valid values, New Relic will assign the indicated type to the metric (and strip the label) before downstream consumption in the data pipeline. If you have multiple metrics that don't follow the above naming conventions, you can add multiple rules with each rule matching different source labels. Customize remote write behavior You can customize the following parameters if you are writing to more than one account in New Relic or are connecting more than one Prometheus data source to the same account in New Relic. For more information, see the docs on remote write tuning. X-License Key Your account's license key is not an API key. The license key is used for authentication and to identify which account to write data into. If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts, use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. Use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Optimize throughput and memory consumption Remote write increases the total memory consumption of your Prometheus servers. If you're experiencing issues we recommend the following: Increase max_samples_per_send for higher throughput workloads, along a proportional increase in capacity. If memory consumption is still a problem, try limiting the number of max_shards per server. Troubleshoot error messages If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, review our remote write troubleshooting documentation. This includes fixing common errors, such as missing or incorrect characters, bad requests, request entity too large, and rate limit errors. Remove the integration When you remove the Prometheus remote write integration, this stops new data from flowing, but it will not purge or remove any historical data. To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file, then restart the server.",

This document describes how you can configure your remote write integration so that New Relic does not keep duplicated metrics. Tip For information on standard Prometheus remote write integration without using a high-availability configuration, see Set up your Prometheus remote write integration. External labels New Relic requires two external labels to deduplicate data from replicas in a high-availability configuration: Label name Description Example value prometheus A label whose value identifies the name of a high-availability cluster or group of Prometheus servers. monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica A label whose value identifies the unique replica sending this data. replica-1 The remaining sections explain how labels work with Prometheus Operator and standalone Prometheus. Prometheus Operator These external labels are added by default if you use Prometheus Operator version 0.19.0 (or higher). This applies whether you use Prometheus Operator directly or via the helm chart. The operator sets the value of the prometheus label (the one identifying a cluster) as <prometheus deployment namespace>/<prometheus deployment name>. For example, if your namespace for the Prometheus deployment is monitoring and the name of the deployment is prometheus-cluster1, the value is monitoring/prometheus-cluster1. The operator sets the value of the prometheus_replica label as the name of the pod for each replica. This follows the format replica-<replica number>, where the number is the ordinal of that replica (for example, the first replica is named replica-1). Tip If you still see duplicate copies of replica data, make sure you do not have replicaExternalLabelName or prometheusExternalLabelName in your Prometheus spec or chart configuration because these overrides change the label name. Standalone Prometheus When deploying a Prometheus server directly, you need to add the external labels to the configuration file. Here are two different example configurations for replicas within the same high-availability cluster: Replica 1 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-1 Copy Replica 2 (prometheus.yml) global: external_labels: prometheus: monitoring-cluster prometheus_replica: replica-2 Copy",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

Common errors and issues If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. For specific information on how to query for NrIntegrationError events, see Investigate error messages below. Configuration errors Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large error This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. Investigate error messages You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following. Run a NrIntegrationError query on the error message using NRQL, then look at the Message field in the UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Copy Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send.

Solution When running the integration in a huge cluster scraping hundreds of targets, CPU and memory consumption will increase, and the number of workers could affect scrape_duration. For example, a Prometheus OpenMetrics integration consumes 2.5 CPU and 700Mb of RAM because: It scrapes 800 targets, exposing 1000 timeseries each. Each one has a latency of 150ms with a scrape_duration of 30 seconds. To reduce resource consumption: Update the integration to the latest available image. Reduce harvest time by lowering emitter_harvest_period. (The default value is 1s, and the interval cannot be smaller than 200ms.) Since metrics are sent more often, memory consumption is reduced. Collect metrics less frequently by increasing scrape_duration to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Reduce the number of workers to reduce both memory consumption and CPU usage. Scraping will slow down and could exceed scrape_duration. To do so: Update the integration to the latest version available of the image.

Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send.

      "body": "Problem You have installed the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes, but you notice sparse data, missing metrics, and data gaps in New Relic's UI. Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional).

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

Solution If some metrics are not being collected regularly, do the following: Check if the CPU is being throttled, and if the memory allocated to the container is enough. In case the container doesn't have enough resources available, it may send data with a longer interval between samples. Low memory limit may cause the integration to be killed and restarted. The correct limits and requests of resources can vary according to the number of targets monitored, and the number of metrics exposed by each target.For more information, see the guidelines in the large environment configuration documentation. Check for the following error message in the logs of the integration: {\"err\":\"unexpected post response code: 413: Request Entity Too Large\"} Copy This issue causes some payloads to be dropped, and it is currently fixed in new releases. If present, update the image to the most recent version. If some /metrics endpoints that are monitored by the integration time out or take several seconds to answer, they may slow down the scraping of data. The integration's performance can degrade if multiple endpoints take a huge amount of time to answer. This leads to intermittent and missing data. To detect those endpoints, run: SELECT average(nr_stats_integration_fetch_target_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO FACET target LIMIT 30 Copy This query retrieves the data exposed by the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, and it shows the time required to fetch each endpoint. Fix the endpoints with a latency above 1s, or exclude them from the monitoring removing the Prometheus scraping label. If it's not feasible to remove these endpoints, and the latency in the answer can't be avoided, configure the integration to run more workers in parallel. This allows the integration to fetch more endpoints at the same time. To do so, update the integration to the most recent version, and apply the new configuration option worker_threads. We advise to do it gradually, from 4, 6, 8 and up to 16. This workaround only minimizes the issue, and if multiple endpoints are misbehaving, performances will still be degraded. Moreover, memory and CPU consumption will increase with the number of workers, so memory and CPU must be increased accordingly. In case all the endpoints monitored have a low latency, and the container is not being throttled, run the following query. This helps you verify how much time the integration is taking to scrape all the targets, and to send the data if it's exceeding the configured scrape_duration. SELECT latest(nr_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds) FROM Metric where clusterName=’clustername' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy First, update the integration to the latest image published. Then, to reduce the time needed to scrape all the targets, increase the number of workers with the configuration option worker_threads. We advise is to do it gradually, from 4 to 6, 8, and up to 16 until r_stats_integration_process_duration_seconds approaches the defined scrape_duration. Note that memory consumption and CPU usage will increase.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube.

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "Do you have a PromQL query you’d like to convert to NRQL? This document provides examples that show you how to convert some common PromQL queries to NRQL queries. You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples. Description Mapping between NRQL and PromQL-style queries Search for attributes: Explore the attributes on the container_memory_usage_bytes metric. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy Find attribute's value: Explore the current value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric for unique id attributes. PromQL: sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (id) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy Visualize the attribute's value: Chart the value of the container_memory_usage_bytes metric with the given id attribute value. PromQL: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = '/' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style query example 1. Start your query. When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

      "body": "To query and visualize the metrics collected for your Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration with New Relic, you can use NRQL. You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed. To view the number of connected Redis clients per pod in the default namespace: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE namespaceName='default' FACET podName TIMESERIES Copy Docker: View average memory free for scraped endpoints This example assumes you are scraping node exporters for Docker and want to use OpenMetrics. To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of. Important For general information about Prometheus queries and operators, see the Prometheus.io documentation. Supported features We support the following aggregation, arithmetic, mathematical, and rate-like functions. As we continue to expand support for Prometheus and PromQL, this list will be updated. Aggregation operators and functions Aggregation operators: avg() count() min() max() quantile() stddev() stdvar() sum() topk() Aggregation functions: histogram_quantile() <aggregation>_over_time() functions: avg_over_time count_over_time min_over_time max_over_time quantile_over_time stdev_over_time stvar_over_time sum_over_time Arithmetic binary operators + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) / (division) % (percent) ^ (power/exponents) Logical operators and or Date/time functions day_of_month() day_of_week() days_in_month() hour() minute() month() time() timestamp() year() Mathematical functions abs() ceil() clamp_max() clamp_min() exp() floor() ln() log10() log2() round() sqrt() Rate-like functions delta() deriv() idelta() increase() irate() rate() Predictive functions predict_linear Time-series selectors We offer support for PromQL time-series selectors including the following: instant vector selectors range series selectors offset modifier Important We only support offset queries if every vector in the query has the same offset value. PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

      "body": "To query and visualize the metrics collected for your Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration with New Relic, you can use NRQL. You can also translate your PromQL-style queries to NRQL using either Grafana or the query builder. All metrics for Docker and Kubernetes are stored in the Metric type. Default attributes for the OpenMetrics integration By default, the following attributes will be added to all metrics for Docker and Kubernetes integrations: Default attributes (all integrations) Description clusterName The name of the cluster provided in the scraper configuration. integrationName The name of this integration (nri-prometheus). integrationVersion The version of the integration; for example, 0.2.0. metricName The name of the metric itself. nrMetricType The type of the New Relic Metric type; for example, Gauges. promMetricType The metric type of the Prometheus metric scrapedEndpoint The URL of the endpoint is being scraped. Kubernetes: If the scraper is running in Kubernetes, New Relic also adds the following attributes to all the metrics: Additional Kubernetes attributes Description deploymentName Name of the deployment, if scraping a pod. label The Kubernetes labels of the object being scraped, prefixed by \"label\". namespaceName Name of the namespace. nodeName Name of the node where the pod being scraped is running, if applicable. podName Name of the pod being scraped, if applicable. serviceName Name of the service being scraped, if applicable Default attributes for the remote write integration By default, the following attributes will be added to Prometheus remote write metrics: Default attributes (all integrations) Description prometheus_server A user supplied label specified as a Prometheus remote write URL parameter. The value supplied should be unique as it is intended to differentiate between source Prometheus servers at query time. Unspecified by default. newrelic.source The name of the New Relic ingest point (prometheusAPI). instrumentation.provider prometheus instrumentation.name remote-write instrumentation.source A user supplied identifier for the source of the Prometheus data that matches the value of prometheus_server. instrumentation.version Used to identify the version of the remote write API; for example, 0.0.1. NRQL query examples When you build queries, be aware that there is no linking between the metrics, entities, and attributes. Use the following NRQL queries to find out which metrics are available and which attributes are present on these metrics: Get metric names To get all metric names for OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' Copy To get metric names for a remote write integration from a single Prometheus source: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE instrumentation.provider='prometheus' AND instrumentation.name='remote-write' AND instrumentation.source='<ds>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics endpoint: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE scrapedEndpoint='<ep>' Copy To get metric names for a specific OpenMetrics cluster, namespace, or pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE clusterName='<cn>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE namespaceName='<ns>' Copy FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE podName='<pod>' Copy Get the attributes for a metric To get all attributes for the selected metric: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName='<mn>' Copy Get the values for an attribute in OpenMetrics The autocomplete will show all values of the attribute, regardless of the pod. To determine the attribute values for a specific pod: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(<attribute>) WHERE metricName='<mn>' AND podName='<pod>' Copy Build the query Using metric name and attributes, you can query your data. For more information about facets, time series, and time selection, see the NRQL documentation. To build PromQL-style queries, see our docs. Get metric values To get raw metric values: FROM Metric SELECT <metricName> WHERE <attribute>='<value>' Copy Get a chart of the metric To get a chart of the metric with an aggregator of average, min, max, or sum: FROM Metric SELECT <aggregator>(<metricname>) WHERE <attribute>='<value>' TIMESERIES Copy Query counter metrics (deltas) Currently the integration calculates the deltas for counter metrics. This is why queries on counter metrics will show the deltas of the counter instead of the absolute value of the counter. View connected Redis clients per pod with OpenMetrics Docker: This example assumes you are scraping Redis exporters. To view the number of connected Redis clients per endpoint in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' FACET scrapedEndpoint TIMESERIES Copy Kubernetes: This example assumes that you have Redis pods with the Redis exporter installed. To view the number of connected Redis clients per pod in the default namespace: FROM Metric SELECT latest(redis_connected_clients) WHERE namespaceName='default' FACET podName TIMESERIES Copy Docker: View average memory free for scraped endpoints This example assumes you are scraping node exporters for Docker and want to use OpenMetrics. To view average memory free for all scraped endpoints in a cluster: FROM Metric SELECT average(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) WHERE clusterName='my-cluster' Copy Kubernetes: View average memory usage for pods in a deployment To view average memory usage for all pods in a Kubernetes deployment using OpenMetrics: FROM Metric SELECT average(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE deploymentName='my-app-deployment' AND namespaceName='default' Copy View data in New Relic When you query the data, you can view the results in the New Relic UI. You can also visualize the data as charts, histograms, etc. To view the NRQL query results for your Prometheus integration's data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Query your data. For more information, see New Relic's query builder documentation. Create histograms and summaries With remote write or version 1.2.0 or higher of the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, you can create histograms and percentiles (summaries) of your data. The OpenMetrics data is based on New Relic's guidelines in GitHub for higher level metric abstractions, while the remote write data closely matches the schema of the original Prometheus data. Data presentation Comments Histograms A bucket <basename>_bucket{le=\"42\"} will be sent as this: For OpenMetrics: <basename>_buckets For remote write: <basename>_bucket The dimension will be this: For OpenMetrics: {histogram.bucket.upperBound=\"42\"} For remote write: {histogram.bucket.le=\"42\"} Percentiles Quantiles (summaries) are transformed into percentiles. A metric <basename>{quantile=\"0.3\"} will be sent to New Relic as <basename>.percentiles. The dimension will be this: {percentile=\"30\"} NRQL has two functions that work on remote write ingested PromQL: bucketPercentile() and histogram(). The links include query examples.These two functions don't work on OpenMetrics ingested buckets. To better support visualization of histograms, percentiles are calculated based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic. To configure the calculated percentiles for OpenMetrics, use the percentiles configuration option.",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "New Relic supports PromQL-style queries, and our query builder offers a PromQL-style query mode that translates PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. Although the method of approximation means that a handful of edge cases are not fully supported, it provides coverage for an overwhelming majority of queries, supporting over 99.5% of queries across the 7.8 million top Grafana dashboard downloads. Read on to learn about how we work with PromQL queries, as well as differences between standard PromQL and our PromQL-like query language we want you to be aware of. Important For general information about Prometheus queries and operators, see the Prometheus.io documentation. Supported features We support the following aggregation, arithmetic, mathematical, and rate-like functions. As we continue to expand support for Prometheus and PromQL, this list will be updated. Aggregation operators and functions Aggregation operators: avg() count() min() max() quantile() stddev() stdvar() sum() topk() Aggregation functions: histogram_quantile() <aggregation>_over_time() functions: avg_over_time count_over_time min_over_time max_over_time quantile_over_time stdev_over_time stvar_over_time sum_over_time Arithmetic binary operators + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) / (division) % (percent) ^ (power/exponents) Logical operators and or Date/time functions day_of_month() day_of_week() days_in_month() hour() minute() month() time() timestamp() year() Mathematical functions abs() ceil() clamp_max() clamp_min() exp() floor() ln() log10() log2() round() sqrt() Rate-like functions delta() deriv() idelta() increase() irate() rate() Predictive functions predict_linear Time-series selectors We offer support for PromQL time-series selectors including the following: instant vector selectors range series selectors offset modifier Important We only support offset queries if every vector in the query has the same offset value. PromQL troubleshooting This section describes differences in behavior between PromQL and our PromQL-style query behavior and how to work with and around these differences. This is particularly relevant if you want to use advanced queries and our PromQL-style mode in the query builder. Metric types Prometheus recommendations note that you should only use some functions, like delta(), on gauges, and only use others like rate() and increase() on counters, but queries in Prometheus still work most of the time even if they don’t follow those instructions. However, because NRDB converts PromQL-style accumulating counters to delta counters, our implementation is unforgiving when using these functions on the wrong data type and will produce different or incorrect answers. For this reason, it's best to follow all Prometheus recommendations when working with our PromQL-style queries, even if you don't follow these recommendations in Prometheus. Limits In order to ensure the stability and performance of our system for all users, we place some limits on what queries can be run. In all cases, we enforce a limit of 366 steps in range queries. We also default to only returning 100 timeseries from queries by default. If you want to see more (or fewer), you need to explicitly add a topk() to your query. (Note that the topk() implementation in our PromQL-style query is different from that of Prometheus.) We limit the total memory a query can use. This means that requests for large numbers of time steps or large numbers of time series may be rejected, particularly if they are combined with an aggregation like unique count or quantile which require significantly more memory to compute than simple arithmetic aggregations. Range vector selectors (sliding windows and smoothing behavior) We provide support for sliding window timeseries aggregations. For more information, see our NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions resource and our sliding windows deep dive. For information on translating between NRQL and our PromQL-style language, see Translate PromQL queries to NRQL. Query range and data scraping intervals The range of your query in PromQL must be larger than the duration of the step size of the query to avoid the error \"TIMESERIES bucket size is larger than the current time window\". We inspect data up to one minute old when servicing instant queries. If your scrape interval is greater than 1 minute, some queries may result in No data found. Avoid this by sending data at least once per minute. If the timeseries unit for your NRQL query is less than the scrape interval for your application, some periods will lack data, and the resulting graph may be jagged or contain peaks and valleys. In general, set the step size to your scrape interval, or higher.",

You can use our PromQL-style query language to explore your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration data along with other data sent to New Relic. Tip To run PromQL-style queries in New Relic One, go to the query builder advanced PromQL-style mode. Prometheus and New Relic metric types The different metric types supported by Prometheus and New Relic are related to each other: New Relic Prometheus Description Count Counter The Prometheus counter is a cumulative sum while the New Relic count is a delta sum. For example, if you see 2 requests in the first reporting period and 3 requests in the second reporting period. The Prometheus counter will report 2 and then 5, while the New Relic count will report 2 and then 3. Gauge Gauge A Prometheus gauge is similar to a New Relic gauge. Multiple counts Histogram Prometheus automatically maps a histogram to a set of counters. In New Relic, these counters should be changed to deltas and reported as counts. Gauges and counts Summary Prometheus represents a Summary with a given basename as the following time series: a basename_sum a basename_count and 0 or more of basename{quantile=\".xx\"...} metrics New Relic maps the _sum as a Summary, the _count as a Counter, and each quantile metric as a Gauge. Summary (No equivalent in Prometheus) New Relic has a distinct metric type called a summary that is different than the Prometheus summary. It is designed for reporting aggregated discrete events so that you can query the count, sum, min, max, and average values. Mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries Tip To see how New Relic translates PromQL-style queries to NRQL, write a query in the query builder PromQL-style tab, then switch to the NRQL tab. This table shows the mapping between NRQL and our PromQL-style queries when exploring data. For more contextual information, see the examples.

When exploring your data for a particular metric in PromQL, such as memory by container usage in bytes, you can start with a query such as: container_memory_usage_bytes Copy This will chart all the unique metric timeseries for the input metric. 2. Filter the query results. Looking at the data, you can add more query parameters to filter down the number of metric timeseries. For example, if you only want timeseries where the id is /, the PromQL-style query will be: container_memory_usage_bytes{id=\"/\"} Copy PromQL-style example: To filter the data, run this PromQL-style query: container_memory_usage_bytes { id=\"/\"}. NRQL query example 1. Query available metrics. To explore your data, start by looking at all the available metrics. Use the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy 2. Find unique attributes. Once you have found the metric you want to review, such as container_memory_usage_bytes, you can find the unique attributes with the following query: FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes' Copy The results will show each available attribute key and the value type (string, boolean, or number). 3. Aggregate and chart the metrics. To chart metrics using NRQL, you first need an aggregation function. For example, you can use latest for gauges, sum for counts, and average for summaries. As the following chart shows, all the unique timeseries are aggregated into one unique timeseries by default: one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = 'container_memory_usage_bytes'. 4. View metrics by ID. To view the unique metric timeseries with various id values, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data you see after running FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) FACET id. 5. Add the selected ID to the query. Next you can select an id value and put it in the NRQL where clause. FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) WHERE id = \"/\" timeseries Copy one.newrelic.com > Query your data: This example shows the data displayed after running From Metric select latest(container_memory_usage_bytes) where id = \"/\" timeseries. Filter examples Both our PromQL-style query language and NRQL provide syntax to filter down the number of unique metric timeseries. PromQL-style uses brackets to filter. NRQL uses a WHERE clause. Here are some example queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Select data with specific values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=\"apiserver\", instance=\"1234\"}) Copy NRQL: To only select data with specific values in NRQL, use the WHERE clause with =. In this example, all data must have the selected value for job and handler. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE job = 'apiserver' AND instance = '1234' TIMESERIES Copy Select data with multiple values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{environment=~\"staging|testing|development\",method!=\"GET\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the in clause to select multiple values for an attribute and the != sign to select all values but the one listed. In this example, the environment can be staging, testing, or development, and the method cannot be GET. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHERE environment IN ('staging', 'testing', 'development') AND method != 'GET' TIMESERIES Copy Select data using partial string values. PromQL: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes{job=~\"api.*\"} Copy NRQL: In NRQL use the LIKE clause to match part of a string value. In this example, all data will be returned where the job attributes start with api. FROM Metric SELECT latest(go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes) WHEREe job LIKE 'api%' TIMESERIES Copy PromQL-style to NRQL query examples You can simulate the following PromQL-style queries with NRQL queries: Description PromQL-style and NRQL queries Measure the per second rate over the last minute of the http_request_total metric. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[1m])) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_request_total), 1 second) TIMESERIES 1 minute Copy Chart the difference of the two metrics, then divide by 1024. PromQL: (instance_memory_limit_bytes - instance_memory_usage_bytes) / 1024 Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(instance_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(instance_memory_usage_bytes)) / 1024 TIMESERIES Copy Provide the summed rate per 30-second interval by each handler. PromQL: sum(rate(http_requests_total[30s])) by (handler) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT rate(sum(http_requests_total), 30 seconds) FACET handler TIMESERIES Copy Chart the difference in the two metrics where the instance is named foo and the fstype is either ext4 or xfs. PromQL: (node_filesystem_free_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{instance='foo',fstype=~\"ext4|xfs\"}) Copy NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT latest(node_filesystem_free_bytes) / latest(node_filesystem_size_bytes) WHERE instance = 'foo' AND fstype IN ('ext4', 'xfs') Copy For more help",

      "body": "This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs. Prometheus OpenMetrics or remote write integration? We currently offer two integration options: Prometheus remote write integration and Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker. We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics. Prometheus remote write integration Prometheus OpenMetrics for Kubernetes or Docker Benefits Use this if you currently have Prometheus servers and want an easy way to access your combined metrics from New Relic. It only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration. You'll be able to access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus. You don't need to make any additional adjustments for data to remain available in Prometheus. Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source. Prometheus High Availability support: We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest. Use this if you’re looking for an alternative or replacement to a Prometheus server that stores all your metrics directly in New Relic. You won’t have to manage any Prometheus servers yourself. You don't need local storage. Keep in mind You will still need to manage your Prometheus servers, although you should be able to reduce your storage retention, and there’ll be fewer query loads to the server. Slightly more complex setup. No support for High Availability replicas. The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation. Recommendations Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better: The scrape interval is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%. Set your filters and configure data to target (see metrics or targets). Balance remote write(s) between one or more new relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits. Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations: You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API. You benefit from more nuanced security and user management options as part of New Relic One. The New Relic Telemetry Data Platform can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place. You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic. Prometheus remote write integration The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward telemetry data from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more. Scale your data and get moving quickly With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can: Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform Combine and group data across your entire software stack Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Prometheus remote write dashboard How it works Signup for New Relic is fast and free — we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps: Generate your remote_write URL. Add the new remote_write URL to the configuration file for your Prometheus server. Restart your Prometheus server. Check for your data. Query and explore! Read the setup docs Add Prometheus data Remote write compatibility and requirements New Relic supports the Prometheus remote write integration for Prometheus versions 2.15.0 or newer. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations New Relic’s Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape Prometheus endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform. With these integrations, you can: Automatically identify a static list of endpoints. Collect metrics that are important to your business. Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI. Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional). Kubernetes OpenMetrics dashboard Reduce overhead and scale your data Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems. Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration blog post. Kubernetes In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the prometheus.io/scrape annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration. Docker The Prometheus OpenMetrics integration gathers all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server. OpenMetrics integrations compatibility and requirements For Kubernetes and Docker OpenMetrics integrations, you should be aware of the following compatibility and requirements information. Kubernetes New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2 and Kubernetes versions 1.9 or higher. The integration was tested using Kubernetes 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For more details, see the metrics API documentation. Important Recommendation: Always run the scraper with one replica. Adding more replicas will result in duplicated data. Docker New Relic has contributed the Prometheus integration to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. This integration supports Prometheus protocol version 2. The integration was tested using Docker 1.9, 1.11, and 1.13 on kops, GKE, and minikube. Limits apply to the metrics you send. For details, see the metrics API documentation. What's next Ready to get moving? Here are some suggested next steps: Read the how-to for completing the remote write integration. Read the how-to for completing the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration. Both integration options generate dimensional metrics that are subject to the same rate limits described in the Metric API.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ > -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"common\": { $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" $ } $ }, $ \"spans\": [ $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"ABC\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"duration.ms\": 12.53, $ \"name\": \"/home\" $ } $ }, $ { $ \"trace.id\": \"123456\", $ \"id\": \"DEF\", $ \"attributes\": { $ \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", $ \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", $ \"duration.ms\": 2.97, $ \"name\": \"/auth\", $ \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"metrics\": [ $ { $ \"name\": \"memory.heap\", $ \"type\": \"gauge\", $ \"value\": 2.3, $ \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, $ \"attributes\": { $ \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" $ } $ } $ ] $ } $ ]' Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) bash Copy $ curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ > -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ > -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ > -d '[ $ { $ \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", $ \"service\": \"login-service\", $ \"customerId\": \"xyz\" $ } $ ]' Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the U.S. Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For standard accounts, you can only have one master account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with sub-accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a master account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new master account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the master account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a master account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Retrieve data from New Relic. Send data to New Relic. Adjust settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The Browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the Browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve Mobile data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "To protect your mobile application's security and your users' data privacy, New Relic only records performance data, as described in this document. We do not collect any data used or stored by the monitored app. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and data privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Data collection When you install New Relic, our mobile monitoring capabilities become part of your iOS or Android app. These capabilities live within your application's \"sandbox,\" so they cannot access anything other than performance data from your mobile app. We do not collect performance data about the device itself, such as battery level. Our mobile SDK agent collects and sends specific data to the New Relic collector, including: Mobile data collected Comments Devices Length of application session Wireless carrier's name The device's model name and manufacturer, and its operating system version Certain package, class, method, and thread names A unique instance identifier Requests and responses URLs of HTTP requests, along with HTTP status code, response time, and size of the request and response body Operating system error code for network failures (HTTP requests that fail to complete) The first 2KB of the response body when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code Android only: A stack trace when the HTTP request receives a 4xx or 5xx response status code The agent sends all data using HTTPS encryption and validates the collector's SSL certificate. This prevents common data sniffing and server spoofing attacks. The agent also removes the query string, fragment identifier, username, and password from each URL before sending the data. Secure data endpoints Our mobile SDK agent sends harvested data to the collectors for processing. You can redirect those data posts to proxy or delegate servers for secure data handling. Android: You can use APIs to specify the URI authority of harvest and crash collector data endpoints. For more information, see the Android agent configuration and feature flags documentation. iOS: For more information, see the iOS agent configuration and feature flags documentation. Unique identifiers Our mobile SDK agent assigns a unique identifier to each installed app instance in order to track discrete installs, identify recurring sessions, and correlate performance over time. Mobile agent Identifiers Android Our Android agent generates a cryptographically strong UUID and stores it in the app's SharedPreferences. For more information, see our Android compatibility and requirements documentation. iOS The security measures used for iOS depend on the agent version. In versions 5.3.5 or higher, the iOS agent uses the IdentifierForVendor property to provide a unique device ID. In versions 5.3.4 or lower, the iOS agent used the SecureUDID open source library. SecureUDID is used by many third party libraries and is an accepted industry standard that does not violate Apple App store guidelines. SecureUDID does not use device hardware identifiers such as IMEI. Note that our mobile SDK does not collect IDFA (Identity For Advertisers). For more information, see our iOS compatibility and requirements documentation. No remote updates New Relic does not have the ability to update mobile agents remotely. Using the agent will not introduce any code into your mobile app without your knowledge. Data storage Our mobile SDK agent stores configuration information using your app's normal preferences or settings API on the mobile device. This configuration includes your: Application token Application version number Android or iOS SDK agent version number Settings such as the maximum number of HTTP requests to track per minute Performance data is buffered in memory. It is never written to the device's storage. Server-side data storage for mobile apps is handled in the same way as all other applications monitored by New Relic. For more information, see our security documentation about hosting and data storage. In general, we retain performance data according to the more generous time period of either your web or your mobile subscription. We also retain aggregate records of the number of active instances of your application. Instrumentation added to your code Our mobile SDK agent injects code into certain method calls within your application in order to collect performance data. This can have the effect of adding stack frames to your application's call graph where our code executes. This allows us to time and monitor the inputs and outputs of various APIs. This added code has been reviewed and tested for security-related flaws, and it incorporates best practices related to secure coding. Because our code runs within your application's process, it is subject to the same rights and restrictions as your own code. In addition, our iOS agent registers an NSURLProtocol handler to track NSURLConnection-based networking activity. This instrumentation is compatible with other custom NSURLProtocol handlers your application may register. The handler is registered within a single application process, so it is unable to monitor networking requests originating from other applications or the underlying operating system. User's IP address Our mobile SDK agent captures the user's IP address to enrich data for additional user information. The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details and allows our customers to diagnose performance issues. IP address lookup values include: App name Country code Region Postal code Latitude Longitude Area code For more information about events and attributes for mobile monitoring, see our data dictionary. New Relic does not retain the user's IP address after the attributes have been mapped. The IP address value is cached in memory for up to six hours before being discarded. If you have questions or concerns about this use of IP addresses with regards to your own regulatory obligations for notice and consent, please contact your privacy or legal teams.",

DistributedTraceSummary MobileRequest MobileRequestError Span Transaction TransactionError InfrastructureEvent Data sources : InfrastructureCloudTrail InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Events category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

Tip tvOS apps using Cocoapods have separate installation procedures. Installing your tvOS application As part of the installation process, New Relic Mobile automatically generates an application token. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string for authenticating each mobile app you monitor in New Relic Mobile. For Admins with existing New Relic accounts, follow these steps to install and configure your application. (If you do not have a New Relic account, see New Relic Mobile.) Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. If applicable: From the Mobile Apps list, select Add a new app From the Get Started page, select tvOS as the platform for mobile monitoring. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Continue with the steps to configure New Relic Mobile. To complete the configuration process for a new mobile app later: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile, then select See Instructions next to your mobile app name. To upgrade an existing tvOS installation: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app) > Settings > Installation. Configuring your tvOS application These procedures to configure your tvOS app also appear on the Get Started page in New Relic. Download and unzip the tvOS SDK for New Relic Mobile. To add the New Relic tvOS Mobile Framework to your Xcode project: Use Finder to drag the NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework folder into your Xcode project, and drop it onto your Project in the Project Navigator window. Follow the prompts to copy items into destination and to create folder references. Add the SystemConfiguration.framework, libc++.tbd, and libz.tbd libraries to your Linker settings. To start the agent: Import the New Relic Mobile Agent header at the top of your prefix.pch. Add + [ NewRelic startWithApplicationToken: < appToken>] to the top of -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: in your AppDelegate.m using the unique application token that is automatically generated. Add a build script to your target's Build Phases and paste the following, replacing PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE with your application token: SCRIPT=`/usr/bin/find \"${SRCROOT}\" -name newrelic_postbuild.sh | head -n 1` /bin/sh \"${SCRIPT}\" \"PUT_NEW_RELIC_APP_TOKEN_HERE\" Copy Clean and build your app, and then run it in the simulator or other device. Within a few minutes you will begin to see data for your iOS app: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (selected app). If you don't, see No data appears. Executing a demo crash (optional) If you have trouble getting your app to crash, the New Relic agent provides an API to execute a demo crash. Recommendation: Add one of these lines of code to a button click event handler as applicable: [NewRelic crashNow]; Copy OR [NewRelic crashNow:@\"<reason>\"]; Copy Changing the logging level (optional) Six log levels are available for mobile apps monitoring: none error warning info verbose ALL To increase your logging level in the app, add this method call before calling startWithApplicationToken: [NRLogger setLogLevels:NRLogLevelALL]; Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Mobile Apps index (standard menu functions available from your list of mobile applications in New Relic Mobile) Mobile Apps Overview page (a summary of your mobile app's performance) Customizing your mobile app settings (Settings tab options to view your mobile app's application token, rename it, change its alert thresholds, or install New Relic Mobile updates) Upgrading New Relic Mobile for tvOS apps (standard upgrade procedures) No data appears (basic troubleshooting steps)",

Here is an example of the workflow to remove your existing tvOS agent framework so you can replace it with a newer version. From the Project Navigator (CMD 1) in Xcode, search for NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework. Right-click or control-click NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework, and select Show in Finder. Drag NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework to the trash. Verify that the Xcode project highlights the reference to NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework in red. Right-click or control-click NewRelicAgentTVOS.framework, and select Delete to remove the obsolete reference from the project. Follow standard installation procedures for tvOS app monitoring. For more help Additional documentation resources include: tvOS installation and configuration (standard installation and configuration procedures) CocoaPods installation and configuration (procedures specific to CocoaPods) Customizing your mobile app settings (Settings tab options to view your mobile app's application token, rename it, or install New Relic Mobile updates)",

Plugins developed with the Ruby SDK for Plugins use the same MIT licenses as New Relic APM's Ruby agent. Plugins developed with the .NET SDK for New Relic Plugins use the same MIT licenses as New Relic APM's .NET agent. Collectors for Plugins use the same MySQL Java licenses as New Relic.

Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: http://newrelic.com/terms IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION. 1. DEFINITIONS “FIT Instrumentation” means the New Relic custom-made software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the FIT Instrumentation shall be treated like an “Agent”, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE FIT INSTRUMENTATION 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the FIT Instrumentation solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the FIT Instrumentation and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the FIT Instrumentation in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the FIT Instrumentation, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the FIT Instrumentation is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that FIT Instrumentation will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the FIT Instrumentation except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the FIT Instrumentation; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the FIT Instrumentation; (iv) use the FIT Instrumentation to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the FIT Instrumentation to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the FIT Instrumentation; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4. DISCLAIMER 4.1 DISCLAIMER. THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE AND NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING. THE ADD-ON IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE ERROR-FREE, COMPATIBLE WITH THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR THAT CUSTOMER WILL ACHIEVE ANY RESULTS FROM USE OF THE ADD-ON THEREFROM. 4.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE ADD-ON OR FOR ANY ERROR OR DEFECT IN THE ADD-ON OR THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION. Customer agrees and acknowledges that: (a) the Add-on is not an official product and has not been commercially released for sale by New Relic; (b) the Add-on may not operate properly, being in final form, or fully functional; (c) the Add-on may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, design flaws, or other problems; (d) it may not be possible to make the Add-on fully functional; (e) the information obtained using the Add-on may not be accurate; (f) use of the Add-on may result in unexpected results, loss of data, delays or other unpredictable damages or loss; (g) New Relic is under no obligation to release a commercial version of the Add-on; and (h) New Relic has the right unilaterally to abandon development of the Add-on, at any time and without any obligation or liability to Customer. 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1 Terms of Service; Documentation. This Agreement shall be considered a part of the New Relic documentation, located at: https://docs.newrelic.com (the “Documentation). This Agreement and the Terms of Service constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-on. In the absence of a separate agreement, upon agreement between New Relic and Customer with respect to the Add-On, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern the relationship between New Relic and Customer with respect to such Add-On. To the extent of a conflict between the Agreement and the Terms of Service, this Agreement shall govern with respect to the Add-on only.",

      "body": "New Relic, Inc. Add-on End User License Agreement In connection with the work provided by New Relic's Expert Services, Field Instrumentation Team, or Sales team, you may be provided with certain custom-created software to visualize, enable, optimize, or enhance your use of New Relic's Services. By downloading, installing, authorizing installation, or using the Add-on (defined below) with your Underlying Software (defined below), you (“Customer”) agree to the terms and conditions herein (“Agreement”) with New Relic, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices located at 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 (“New Relic\"), (collectively the “Parties”). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”). For the purposes of the Terms of Service, the Add-on shall be treated like an Agent, subject to the separate terms herein. 2. USE OF THE PROGRAMMABILITY ADD-ON 2.1 Software Evaluation License. Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Add-on is made to work with the Underlying Software as configured at the time of creation and there is no guarantee that Add-on will continue to work in the event Customer changes, replaces, upgrades versions of, updates, or otherwise changes the Underlying Software (an “Upgrade Event”). Customer shall hold New Relic harmless from any claims or damages arising from Customer’s Upgrade Event. 2.5 Restrictions. Customer will not: (i) use the Add-on except as permitted hereunder; (ii) distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Add-on; (iii) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any software underlying the Add-on; (iv) use the Add-on to damage, disable, overburden or impair any New Relic server or network(s) connected to any New Relic server or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Services; (v) use the Add-on to defraud, defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or infringe the rights of privacy or other intellectual property rights of others or otherwise violate any applicable law; (vi) circumvent or modify any security technologies included as part of the Add-on; or (vii) attempt or permit any third party to do any of the foregoing. New Relic may suspend Customer usage of the Services, without notice, pending any investigation of misuse. These restrictions may be supplemented or superceded (to the extent they conflict) by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy as may be published and updated from time to time on the New Relic web site at docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy. 3.

      "body": "This is a glossary of terms that appear in contracts for our original product-based pricing. For New Relic One pricing plan terms, see New Relic One pricing definitions. App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

To begin with, we recommend that all New Relic users become familiar with these resources: New Relic Status Page: Get updates on any incidents New Relic Documentation: Comprehensive guidance for using our platform New Relic Community forum: Thousands of customer questions asked and answered New Relic Diagnostics: Diagnose and troubleshoot installation and configuration New Relic Open Source: Discover, research, and contribute to our open source projects New Relic Security Overview: Our approach to handling security issues You may find these resources helpful too: New Relic Developers: Resources for building custom observability applications New Relic University: A range of online training for New Relic users of every level New Relic on GitHub: Discuss issues and features related to our Open Source projects We are committed to providing documentation and tools to assist with installation, configuration, and diagnostics of New Relic’s distributed software as described here: New Relic Installation, configuration, and requirements Support channels If you need assistance with New Relic Products, you are in good hands with several support channels available to you depending on the service level associated with your New Relic account. For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. Open source project categories New Relic Open Source Projects are assigned to one of five different categories. These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github, Community, and Ticketed Support channels, depending on the service level associated with the New Relic account. Community projects: Actively maintained by New Relic. Support requests can be made through Github or Community. New Relic One catalog: Support requests can be made through the Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. Example code: Project support is through Github channel. Issues/Pull Requests should be directed to the relevant Github repository. New Relic experimental: Projects have no ongoing maintenance, development or support. Archived: Projects are read-only, are not actively maintained, and do not have support. Open source support includes Support for Community Plus Projects from New Relic’s Global Technical Support includes: Troubleshooting problems with the Community Plus Projects on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues with Community Plus Projects during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration of Community Plus Projects in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data with Community Plus Projects into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines with Community Plus Projects Identifying bugs in Community Plus Projects Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Open source support does not include Open source projects assigned to categories other than the Community Plus category Unsupported environments & frameworks Code development End of Life Beta or Limited Release Troubleshooting of customer environment Troubleshooting third-party tools and services Product training Consultancy services Support videos For a library of additional videos, webinars, and other information about using New Relic features, visit New Relic University and newrelic.com/resources.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here.

The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties.

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here. Some default reporting limits are located in these tools' configuration docs. Manage data Want to manage your New Relic data ingest and storage to improve data organization or reduce billing?

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic.

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic.

New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously.

So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

For more information about service levels, please refer to our Support Plan. Community forum The New Relic Community Forum is 100% free and open to anyone with a New Relic account. The community is a place where many customer questions have already been asked and answered. Answers come from our community of experienced users, New Relic Support Engineers, and dozens of other Relics who help answer questions and solve problems. If you want to ask a question, check the community - if your question has not already been answered, members of the community can help. Github We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. You can find all our open source projects in our Github repo. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to. For more information on support for Open Source projects, visit our Open Source Support Policy. Diagnostic tools New Relic offers a diagnostics utility that can automatically detect common problems with New Relic agents. If Diagnostics detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. New Relic Diagnostics can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. We have also made available Troubleshooting Frameworks that step users through common troubleshooting questions. Support ticket Support is now available in the New Relic One Platform! Just click on the question mark at the top right of your New Relic One screen to surface contextual documentation and resources. Depending on the Service Level associated with your New Relic account, you may be eligible for ticketed support and can open a ticket without leaving the New Relic One Platform. As an alternative, customers eligible for ticketed support may also open a support ticket from the New Relic Support page We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to help you troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One Platform and generally available New Relic Products as outlined below. Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries. End of Life New Relic may EOL products in accordance with the EOL policy. We recommend upgrading to our newest versions so you can take advantage of recent capabilities and bug fixes. More details are available in our published End of Life Policy. Beta or Limited Release Our support team covers generally available New Relic Products. Products that are in Beta or Limited Release status are not considered “generally available.” If you are invited to participate in a Beta program, or are using a Limited Release component, your account team will be your point of contact for questions. Please contact your account representative directly. Troubleshooting of customer environment We want to help every customer get the most of their New Relic experience within what are increasingly complex environments. However, we can’t help with things we didn’t build. We cannot assist with administration, configuration, or troubleshooting of a customer environment. When in doubt, you can get in touch with us, and we’ll help verify whether an issue is with our Product within a supported environment so you know where to go next. Troubleshooting third-party tools & services New Relic integrates well with many Third Party tools and services; however, we cannot support tools and services not provided or licensed by New Relic. We’ll do our best to determine whether an issue is with New Relic’s Products or caused by something outside of our control and purview. Issues with installation or configuration of the Third Party tools and services themselves should be directed to the respective owner of that Third Party tool or service or to the developer community. The Community and GitHub are great resources for assistance with Third Party tools and services as well. Some account-related functions For security reasons, some account-related Product functions must be conducted by the New Relic user designated as the “account owner,” such as Enabling SSO and High-Security Mode, adding users, and upgrading user permissions. Product training We are here to help you solve problems you may encounter on the road to instrumenting everything. Global Technical Support cannot provide user training on New Relic Products. New Relic offers a well-curated library of documentation and in-depth tutorials organized by Product, skill level, learning format, and solutions to help you navigate the observability journey. Check out New Relic University! Consultancy services Global Technical Support is here to help our valued customers as outlined in these support offerings. If you need help with something that falls outside of the Scope of Support, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can help you navigate the challenges of building modern software and adopting the latest technologies, so you can focus on what you do best: delivering an incredible experience to your customers. Open source support We want everyone to monitor their systems, and we're contributing our technology back to the open-source community to make that happen. We're committed to open standards, open-sourcing all of our instrumentation, and engaging engineers where they are, in the communities they already belong to.

These categories determine the support options available for a project as listed below: Community plus projects: Actively maintained by New Relic.

New Relic Properties do not include Third-Party Services If you choose to use any Third Party Services, your use of Third-Party Services is wholly subject to your separate agreement with the relevant provider. New Relic bears no responsibility or liability for Third-Party Services. If you enable a Third-Party Service with the New Relic Properties, New Relic may access and exchange Customer Data with the Third-Party Service on your behalf and instruction. “Third-Party Services” means any third party platform, add-on, service, or product not provided by New Relic and that a User integrates or enables for use with the Service, including third-party applications and plug-ins. Open source software that New Relic makes separately available for download (e.g. community tools) is, as required, governed by the terms of the applicable open source license. The license for any open source software identified as included in New Relic Properties will, as required, wholly apply to your use of that open source software. Updates, Contact Information and Violations We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP. You can report a violation of this AUP to: AUP@newrelic.com. Or by mail at: Attn: Legal New Relic, Inc. 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200 San Francisco, CA 94105 This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others. In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties. As used in this AUP, “you” may refer to an individual user or the legal entity an individual user is employed by that has contracted with New Relic, and “we” means New Relic.",

Overview of limits We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently so that our services are available to all our users. To prevent data usage spikes in one New Relic account from impacting other customers' accounts, we have various data volume and rate limits in place. We reserve the right to enforce these limits to protect our system and to avoid issues for you and other customers. If your New Relic account, whether by configuration or by error, exceeds one of these limits, it or its sub-accounts might experience one or both of the following: Sampling of data Temporary pause or cessation of data collection To learn more about how hitting a limit can affect your data, see View limits. If you have further questions about these limits, your contract, or a limit you've reached, contact your New Relic account representative. We can work with you to adjust any rate limits to meet your needs. View limits and manage data Want to understand your account’s limit violations using the UI? See View limits. Want to manage your data for organization or billing purposes? See Manage data. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). This does not include metric timeslice data. Data ingest APIs Our ingest APIs have additional limits that may override the more general account-level limits. Note that these limits also apply to our tools that use these APIs (like our Telemetry SDKs or our open source telemetry integrations). Metric API (dimensional metrics) Event API Log API Trace API Other agent and integration limits To find limits for our other agents and integrations, which will override more general account-level limits, see the docs for those tools: you can search our solutions here. Some default reporting limits are located in these tools' configuration docs. Manage data Want to manage your New Relic data ingest and storage to improve data organization or reduce billing?

Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the New Relic Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) available here: newrelic.com/termsandconditions/terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO NOT USE THE ADD-ON. 1. DEFINITIONS “Add-on” means the New Relic applications and/or software, including but not limited to connectors, extensions, UI extension, and plugins, provided by New Relic to Customer to enable the Services to operate with certain third party or Customer software or systems (“Underlying Software”).

Subject to the terms herein, New Relic grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable right to install, use, and configure the Add-on solely as needed to enable the Services for internal evaluation purposes. New Relic reserves all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.2 Ownership. As between the Parties, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest to the Add-on and Feedback, including but not limited to any intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any Customer Data processed by the Add-on in connection with the Services. 2.3 Feedback. Customer agrees to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, requests or recommendations (“Feedback”) regarding the Add-on, and hereby irrevocably assigns all intellectual property and proprietary rights it holds in the Feedback to New Relic. 2.4 Notice.

CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (a) the Programmability Add-on, and any features, results or output produced by, and other information relating to the Add-on (including, without limitation, all Feedback); and (b) any business or technical information of New Relic including but not limited to any technical information, research, development, know-how that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. 3.2 Restrictions. Customer will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement. Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information. Customer may disclose Confidential Information to those of its employees who have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for the performance of this Agreement; provided that each such employee first executes a written agreement that contains use and nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Customer; (b) is rightfully known by Customer at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by Customer without access or use of any Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure. 4.

NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND CUSTOMER. 4.3 EVALUATION VERSION.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

If you subscribe to New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained in your Terms are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products on a product-based pricing basis, any service level availability commitment are contained in (i) your Terms, or (ii) if your Terms explicitly references this Service Level Availability commitment applying to the Service purchased in an Order, this page for the Services you use. Capitalized terms not defined below shall take on the meaning set forth in your Terms. New Relic Service Level Availability The Service will be considered available so long as Customer is able to log in to its interface and view Customer Data (\"Service Availability\"). The applicable Service Availability will be calculated as a percentage of: (1) the total number of minutes in a month after (2) subtracting any periods of unavailability during such month from the total number of minutes in a month. New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Service Availability of at least 99.8% during any calendar month. In the event the Service Availability drops below: (i) 98.5% for two consecutive calendar months during the Subscription Term, or (ii) 96.5% in any single calendar month, Customer may request to terminate the relevant Service with no penalty. Such termination will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period and no additional fees will be charged. The service level within New Relic's control is the Service Availability, not, for example, the transmission of data over the public Internet. Service Availability calculations will exclude unavailability arising from any: (a) planned maintenance periods; (b) emergency maintenance that is necessary to prevent imminent harm to the Service; (c) force majeure events; (d) Third-Party Services, Customer application, equipment, software or other technology, or Customer or its User's use of the Service, in violation of the Agreement or not in accordance with the Documentation; or (e) suspension, limitation, and/or termination of Customer’s access or use of the Service in accordance with this Agreement. This describes Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for failures of Service Availability. Customer may request the Service Availability attainment for the previous month by filing a support ticket on the New Relic support site.",

New Relic Pre-Release Policy Through your use of any New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”) Pre-Release Services (as further defined), you signify that you have read, understood, and accept the terms of this Pre-Release Policy (the “Policy”) governing your use and participation in New Relic’s program for making beta, alpha and pre-release versions of New Relic software (i.e. agents, SDKs, APIs, integrations, private locations, code, etc.), services, features, user-interfaces, and platforms made available for evaluation purposes (the “Pre-Release Service(s)”). This Policy is effective on behalf of yourself or the entity(ies) associated with your New Relic account (collectively referred to herein as “you” or “your”) as of your date of first use of the Pre-Release Service(s) (the “Effective Date”), which means that your choice to use the Pre-Release Service(s) means that you have the legal authority to use the Pre-Release Service(s) personally or on behalf of the company or organization associated with your New Relic account in accordance with this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully as your use of Pre-Release Service(s) may have unintended consequences and materially impact your data or use of the New Relic services and products. If you do not agree to this Policy, your sole remedy is to not make use of the Pre-Release Services. 1. Introduction This Policy and any New Relic technical guides and documentation made available with the Pre-Release Service(s) or from the dedicated ‘Documentation’ page of the New Relic website (the “Documentation”) enables you to test experimental features and products before they are made generally available. New Relic reserves the right to withhold or discontinue any Pre-Release Service(s), which may be designated as an alpha, beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, technology preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description, in its sole discretion and provides no guarantee that any Pre-Release Service(s) will eventually be made commercially or generally available. Pre-Release Service(s) are versions provided before they are generally available and may have bugs, stability issues, or other problems. Use of the Pre-Release Service(s) may result in unexpected results, loss of data, outages, or other damage to your systems or networks. New Relic advises against using the Pre-Release Service(s) in production. No support is offered with or for Pre-Release Service(s). You hereby release New Relic from any liability arising from or related to your use of the Pre-Release Service(s). In connection with your use of the Pre-Release Services, you may provide feedback, comments, and/or suggestions based on or relating to the Pre-Release Services (“Feedback”). The Pre-Release Services and any related information, including without limitation features, functionality, designs, user interface, capabilities, specifications, architectural diagrams, usage data, APIs, deployment schedules, email lists, bug databases, know how, source code, potential features, Feedback, and information related to any business or technical information of New Relic, including without limitation product plans, costs, prices, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, research, development, and negotiations are considered confidential information of New Relic (“Confidential Information”). 2. License and Restrictions 2.1 Evaluation License. Subject to your compliance with the Policy, New Relic hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, during the term of this Policy, to use the Pre-Release Service(s) in accordance with the Documentation solely for the purpose of internal evaluation and supplying Feedback to New Relic. 2.2 License Restrictions.

You acknowledge and agree that, as between you and New Relic, New Relic owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Pre-Release Service(s), Confidential Information, and Feedback, including but not limited to all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. New Relic and its licensors reserve all rights and licenses not expressly granted herein. 2.4 Feedback. You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of New Relic. You hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to New Relic all right, title, and interest in all Feedback, including but not limited to all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. 3. Confidential Information You will not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Policy, and you will use reasonable efforts to protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure. You may disclose Confidential Information only to those employees with a bona fide need to know, provided that each employee has signed a written agreement with nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein.

You acknowledge and agree that you should not rely on the Pre-Release Service(s) for any reason. You further acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting all data and information that is stored, retrieved, or otherwise processed by the Pre-Release Service(s) in accordance with your contractual obligations and requirements under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, you are responsible for all costs and expenses required to backup and restore any data and information that is lost or corrupted as a result of your use of the Pre-Release Service(s) or any Unintended Effects. You understand and agree that your Data may be transferred to the United States for storage, processing, and use by New Relic to provide the Pre-Release Service(s). For any data that you process using the Pre-Release Service(s), you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and consent to do so. New Relic has no obligation to store any data you process using the Pre-Release Service(s) and shall have no liability for the deletion or accuracy of such data. 4.3 Warranty Disclaimers. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF THE COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NEW RELIC MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR SECURE. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SERVICE(S) IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 4.4 Modifications. New Relic may change the Policy from time to time as our business changes and technology evolves, and future versions of our generally available services may not be compatible with Pre-Release Service(s) built using previous versions. The most current version of this Policy will be posted in the Documentation. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately for all users in instances to comply with applicable law, for new users of a Pre-Release Service(s) and, for all other users, any changes to this Policy will be effective as of fifteen (15) days after posting notice of such changes. If we determine in our sole discretion that an update is material, we will provide notice of such material change to you through your New Relic account, the Pre-Release Service(s), the Documentation, our blogs or community forums, and/or by email to the email address of your account administrator. We may require you to provide consent to the updated Policy in a specified manner before further use of the Pre-Release Service(s) is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s), your sole remedy is to stop using the Pre-Release Service(s) and any such termination by you shall be without penalty except as specified in this Policy. Otherwise, your use of any Pre-Release Service(s) after any such update shall constitute acceptance of the then-current Policy. 5. Limitation of Liability TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT NEW RELIC HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. NEW RELIC’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS POLICY, THE PRE-RELEASE SERVICES, OR ANY UNINTENDED EFFECTS WILL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEW RELIC AND YOU. 6.

Export Restrictions You acknowledge that the software in the Pre-Release Service(s) licensed hereunder may be subject to the export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. You agree that you will not export or re-export the Pre-Release Service(s), any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct product of the Pre-Release Service(s) to any country, person or entity subject to U.S. export restrictions. 8. Termination Your access to the Pre-Release Service(s) will terminate upon the earliest of: (i) New Relic making the Pre-Release Service(s) or a successor version of the Pre-Release Service(s) generally available or available for commercial release; (ii) New Relic ceasing to make the Pre-Release Service(s) available to you; or (iii) New Relic terminating this Policy.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions. Customer will not (a) sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, time-share or otherwise provide access to any copies of the Software, or portions thereof, to a third party; (b) modify, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Software; (c) use the Software to develop services or products for sale or include any components of the Software in any product; (d) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices in the Software; or (e) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including benchmarks) relating to the Software. 3. Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

      "body": "Proprietary license New Relic Diagnostics license terms These New Relic Diagnostics License Terms (“Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions under which you (“Customer”) may use New Relic Diagnostics (the “Software”), as made available by New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). By clicking “accept” or downloading or using the Software, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company, then “Customer” means your company and you are binding your company to these Terms. 1. License Grant. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms, New Relic grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software in accordance with its documentation in support of Customer’s use of New Relic products to which Customer has a separate subscription (“New Relic Products”). Unless otherwise specified, there is no fee for use of the Software. 2. License Restrictions.

Ownership. Except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, New Relic and its suppliers have and will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, and all copies, updates, modifications and derivative works thereof. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under these Terms or otherwise. 4. Usage Data. Customer agrees that New Relic and its affiliates have the right to collect Usage Data from Customer through the Software and use Usage Data to support, operate and improve New Relic products and services and for other lawful business purposes. “Usage Data” means diagnostics data related to the use of the Software with New Relic Products, including, without limitation, configuration information, details on diagnostics tasks, New Relic account and application ID numbers and New Relic license keys. For clarity, Usage Data is not considered “Customer Data”, “your Data” or any other similar term as used in any applicable subscription or license agreement for New Relic Products. At Customer’s election, Customer may disable the collection of Usage Data as described in the Software documentation. 5. Disclaimers. New Relic is not obligated to provide any support or maintenance for the Software. ALL USE OF SOFTWARE IS AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK. SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE AT APPLICABLE LAW, NEW RELIC’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED $50. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND NEW RELIC WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. THESE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 7. Changes and Termination. At its discretion, without notice or liability to Customer, New Relic may (a) update, modify or discontinue the Software; (b) modify these Terms, effective upon posting; or (c) terminate or suspend these Terms or Customer’s access to the Software. If Customer does not agree with any modification, its sole remedy is to terminate its use of the Software. Upon any termination or suspension, Customer must stop using the Software. 8. Third Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with third party code (including code which may be made available to Customer in source code form). A list of third party code and ownership, use, warranty and modification rights with respect to such code may be identified in the documentation or provided by New Relic upon Customer’s written request. New Relic is not responsible for applications and services not licensed by New Relic. 9. Export Compliance. Customer acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. Customer shall not remove or export from the U.S. or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any U.S. or foreign agency or authority. Customer agrees to the foregoing and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. 10. Government End-Users. The Software is commercial computer software. If Customer is an entity of the U.S. government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, is restricted by a license agreement or by these Terms in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. 11. General. These Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the U.S. without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California. The parties are independent contractors. Customer may not assign these Terms without New Relic’s prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; New Relic may assign these Terms freely to any party without Customer’s consent. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect. These Terms are the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Software, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements (oral or written) relating to the Software. Any separate agreement Customer has for New Relic Products does not apply to the Software. Open-source licenses We love open-source software, and use the following in New Relic Diagnostics.

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",

      "body": "The Usage Plan applies to (i) your Pay As You Go subscription, or (ii) your Commitment Term for the Annual Pool of Funds subscription. New Relic may modify the Usage Plan from time to time. Any changes to the Usage Plan will become effective immediately for changes that provide a benefit or right to the Customer, all other changes will become effective if Customer assents or upon any new or renewal Commitment Term. Usage Plan - Effective as February 19, 2021: The Order and Usage Plan may contain defined terms that are denoted by capitalization. In the event that a capitalized term is not defined in either the Order or the Usage Plan, such terms shall have the meaning set forth in the New Relic One pricing definitions page. Pay As You Go By electing and subscribing to the Pay As You Go subscription model (“Pay As You Go” or “PAYG”), Customer commits to paying for the New Relic Products on a month-to-month consumption basis. Monthly Product Usage will be invoiced regardless if a PO is required or not. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Customer’s usage of the Products in excess of the Free Tier each month shall be billed in arrears on the first business day of the following month based on the Customer’s Per Unit usage of each Product each month multiplied by the corresponding rates set forth in an Order and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Annual Pool of Funds By electing and subscribing to the Annual Pool of Funds subscription model (“Annual Pool of Funds” or “APoF”) for the Commitment Term, Customer commits in an Order to: (i) paying the Commitment Fee amounts described in the Subscription table and any additional commitment fees set forth; and (ii) the Monthly Discounted Fee Rates applying to Customer’s Monthly Product Usage. New Relic will invoice the Commitment Fee as per the ‘Billing Terms’ described in an Order. On a monthly cadence during the Commitment Term, Customer’s Per Unit usage of the Products will be multiplied by the corresponding Monthly Discounted Rate and summed (“Monthly Product Usage”). Monthly Product Usage will be deducted from the Commitment Fee amounts that are paid in advance. If Monthly Product Usage exceeds any such remaining unconsumed amounts, Customer will be invoiced for the difference (“Additional Usage”), including for any Monthly Product Usage during the last month of the Commitment Term. Payment of such invoices will be governed as set forth in the Terms. Any Customer dispute to Monthly Product Usage from the prior month must be in good-faith and received by New Relic in writing within three (3) business days of the start of the next month (including for any Monthly Product Usage for the last month of the Commitment Term) or such dispute notice will be considered invalid. The dispute notice will set forth in reasonable detail the information concerning the disputed charges. The parties will use good-faith efforts to promptly resolve any disputed charges. Any unconsumed balances from the Customer payment of each annual Commitment Fee and any additional payments, if applicable, as set out in an Order will expire and lapse at the end of each year of the Commitment Term. Applicable Invoicing and Order Terms All amounts stated in an Order are non-cancelable payment obligations of the Customer for the Commitment Term regardless of usage. Any fees paid are non-refundable and do not represent a deposit for, or a credit towards, the purchase of other products not specified in an Order or for any purchase after the Commitment Term. Customer acknowledges that a final payment for the full outstanding amount of any remaining unpaid Commitment Fee and/or Monthly Product Usage Fee may be invoiced upon each anniversary date of the term start date. Tax will be added where applicable. New Relic may review Customer's use of the Products at any time. If New Relic identifies any Customer usage of the Product(s) that is not in accordance with the Terms or Documentation, New Relic may suspend such unauthorized usage. All existing purchases and related pricing in effect prior to the execution of an Order shall remain in force. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, an Order does not modify or amend any existing purchases. Additional future products or quantities are not subject to promotional pricing unless otherwise stated in an Order. In the event that a Customer indicates in an Order that it requires a purchase order (“PO”) for its subscription, Customer agrees to provide the required PO prior to the provisioning of the Products. If a Customer does not indicate a PO is required, Customer agrees that New Relic may issue invoice(s) and is entitled to such payment without a PO reference. All Additional Usage fees will be invoiced regardless of a PO requirement. The Product(s) are deemed accepted upon its provisioning. User Accounts Use of the Products require Customer users to create Login Credentials. Customer user Login Credential information must be accurate, current, and complete. New Relic’s use and collection of Login Credentials (in accordance with its General Data Privacy Notice) is for account and product management and support of its customers. Customer and Customer users must abide by the New Relic Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and Login Credentials may not be shared. Each Customer user must have their own user account. Entry into an Order indicates your agreement that the amount of provisioned users (at the rate specified in the Order) applies in lieu of and supersedes any other amount of users of the Products that may be specified in the agreement between Customer and New Relic. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Service Level Availability Commitment With a subscription to New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products, you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable service level availability commitment set forth on the ‘Service level availability commitment’ page in the Documentation shall apply to the Products. For clarity, if your agreement with New Relic contains a different service level availability commitment or remedies, the above does not apply to your subscription to the New Relic Full Stack Observability Pro or Enterprise Products. If you subscribe to any other New Relic Products with New Relic One pricing, any service level availability commitment or related remedies contained within your agreement with New Relic are vacated and nullified, and New Relic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make New Relic Full Stack Observability Standard and Telemetry Data Platform available in line with industry standards. New Relic One Pro and Enterprise Support Plans With a subscription to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), New Relic provides an updated support plan commitment. By subscribing to New Relic One Users (Full Stack Observability), you agree that during the Commitment Term the applicable Support Plan set forth on the ‘Support plan’ page in the Documentation shall apply in lieu of, and supersedes and replaces, any other support related commitments that may be contained within your agreement with New Relic. For New Relic K.K. customers (Japan), the above does not currently apply to the support offerings provided by New Relic to you. Free tier, ‘lite’, no-charge, preview access, New Relic One - Data, New Relic One - Standard User subscriptions If you are using New Relic’s Products in the free tier only, or on a no-charge, or a ‘lite’ or ‘preview access’ basis you agree that the Unpaid Terms of Service will apply to such Product usage and replace and supersede any other terms. In addition, if your subscription contains the New Relic One - Standard User (Full Stack Observability Standard) Product, you agree that the Paid Terms of Service will apply to your subscription to the Products set forth in an Order and replace and supersede any other terms.",

App An app means the application software designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices. Each app includes a predefined number of users. App transaction An app transaction is an APM application's attempt to process a web or non-web request. In APM these manifest as throughput TIMESERIES or individually as events in the Transaction event type. AWS Lambda event An AWS Lambda event means the row of data collected from the customer's AWS Lambda function by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the New Relic platform. It consists of the AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, or custom event types. Check A check means the single instance of a Synthetics monitor running in New Relic's monitoring network and reporting back response time, and whether the check was a success or failure. Compute unit A compute unit means the measure of resources associated with a unit of computation on a physical or virtual host. Datapoints per minute Datapoints per minute (DPM) refers to the per-minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the New Relic Metric Ingest API. For billing purposes, datapoints per minute are calculated as a monthly average value by summing the datapoints ingested during a 30 day period and dividing by the number of minutes in that period (43,200). Event An event means the row of data collected from the customer's application by the New Relic agent or sent from an external service into the Insights event database. Host A host means the physical computer or virtual machine instance running a single copy of an operating system. Host usage is tracked monthly by summing the hours that every host in the account is connected to New Relic and dividing by 750. A host is counted if it is connected any time during an hour. Incident event An incident event is an alerting event (open, closed, etc.) created by an alerting engine that is sent into the New Relic Applied Intelligence platform (non-unique) for de-duplication, flapping detection, smart suppression, enrichment, and correlation. Page view A page view means the full page load (triggering an onLoad event) or a recorded URL change (state change). Per GB daily Per GB daily represents a daily average of Log data sent to New Relic over a 30 day period. Span A span represents an operation summary collected from the customer's application via the New Relic APM agent or New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda agent, or sent from other tracing tools to the New Relic Trace API. User A user means the individual that connects to your app from a single device. Each unique device is considered as a unique user.",
